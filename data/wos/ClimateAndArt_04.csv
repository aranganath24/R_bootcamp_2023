As a result of global climate change these hazards are expected to change in the future, with areas of the globe becoming hotspots  for the intensification of these extremes. This paper is the first global review of the state- of-the-art research on hotspots for floods and drought. The work follows a systematic literature review of published research, and analyses and categorizes the results of 122 published papers after a methodical screening process. The analysis highlighted the geographical areas where increasing hazards are anticipated (e.g., Europe for both floods and droughts), and those areas of the globe where no significant research has been published (e.g., Russia). The methods used to undertake the research are analyzed and new trends identified. Potential avenues for future research are highlighted, including the incorporation of uncertainty analyses into hydro-hazard assessments, the consideration of multi-hazards and their interconnections, and finally the consideration of dynamic vulnerability and exposure in conjunction with changing hydro-hazards to understanding future risk.","[Beevers, Lindsay] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Infrastructure & Environm, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Popescu, Ioana] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Hydroinformat & Socio Tech Innovat, Delft, Netherlands; [Pregnolato, Maria; Liu, Yuexiao] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, England; [Wright, Nigel] Univ Birmingham, Sch Engn, Birmingham, England",University of Edinburgh; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Bristol; University of Birmingham,"Beevers, L (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Infrastructure & Environm, Edinburgh, Scotland.",l.beevers@ed.ac.uk,,"Pregnolato, Maria/0000-0003-0796-9618; Liu, Yuexiao/0000-0002-9026-3108","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (ESPRC) LWEC (Living With Environmental Change) Fellowship [EP/R00742X/2, EP/N030419]; China Scholarship Council-University of Bristol Joint PhD Scholarships Program [201808420207]; European Union [101003518]",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (ESPRC) LWEC (Living With Environmental Change) Fellowship; China Scholarship Council-University of Bristol Joint PhD Scholarships Program; European Union(European Commission),Funding LB was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (ESPRC) LWEC (Living With Environmental Change) Fellowship (EP/N030419).

The accuracy of these models is vital, not only for understanding and predicting air quality globally, but also since they are used to quantify the contribution of ozone in the troposphere and lower stratosphere to climate change, where its greenhouse effect is largest. We briefly describe available northern mid-latitude ozone measurements, which include representative and reliable data from European sites that extend back to the 1950s. We use the SOCOLv3 (Solar Climate Ozone Links version 3) global chemistry-climate model to investigate the individual terms of the tropospheric ozone budget. These include: inflow from the stratosphere, dry deposition, and chemical formation and destruction. For 1960 to 2000 SOCOLv3 indicates a tropospheric ozone increase at 850 hPa over the Swiss Alps (Arosa) of 17 ppb, or around 30%. This increase is smaller than that seen in the surface ozone measurements but similar to other chemistry-climate models, including those with more complex NMVOC (Non Methane Volatile Organic Compound) schemes than SOCOLv3' s. It is likely that the underestimated increase in tropospheric ozone could be explained by issues in the underlying emissions inventories used in the model simulations, with ozone precursor emissions, particularly NOx (NO + NO2), from the 1960s being too large.","[Staehelin, Johannes; Tummon, Fiona; Stenke, Andrea; Peter, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Revell, Laura] Bodeker Sci, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Staehelin, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",Johannes.Staehelin@env.ethz.ch; Fiona.Tummon@env.ethz.ch; laura@bodekerscientific.com; andrea.stenke@env.ethz.ch; thomas.peter@env.ethz.ch,"Revell, Laura/ABG-7040-2020; Peter, Thomas/B-2529-2018; Stenke, Andrea/GYJ-6299-2022","Revell, Laura/0000-0002-8974-7703; Peter, Thomas/0000-0002-7218-7156; Stenke, Andrea/0000-0002-5916-4013; Tummon, Fiona/0000-0002-6459-339X",,,,,69,15,15,1,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,SEP,2017,9,,,,,,163,10.3390/atmos8090163,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos8090163,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,FH9JT,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000411527500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

They influence vertical mixing of energy, moisture and pollutants, cloud formation, and surface ozone destruction. Their climatic variability is related to that of sea ice and planetary albedo, important factors in climate feedback mechanisms. However, climatological polar SBI properties have not been fully characterized nor have climate model simulations of SBIs been compared comprehensively to observations. Using 20 years of twice-daily observations from 39 Arctic and 6 Antarctic radiosonde stations, this study examines the spatial and temporal variability of three SBI characteristic frequency of occurrence, depth (from the surface to the inversion top), and intensity (temperature difference over the SBI depth) and relationships among them. In both polar regions, SBIs are more frequent, deeper, and stronger in winter and autumn than in summer and spring. In the Arctic, these tendencies increase from the Norwegian Sea eastward toward the East Siberian Sea, associated both with (seasonal and diurnal) variations in solar elevation angle at the standard radiosonde observation times and with differences between continental and maritime climates. Two state-of-the-art climate models and one reanalysis dataset show similar seasonal patterns and spatial distributions of SBI properties as the radiosonde observations, but with biases in their magnitudes that differ among the models and that are smaller in winter and autumn than in spring and summer. SBI frequency, depth, and intensity are positively correlated, both spatially and temporally, and all three are anticorrelated with surface temperature.","[Zhang, Yehui; Seidel, Dian J.] NOAA, Air Resources Lab, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Golaz, Jean-Christophe] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Deser, Clara; Tomas, Robert A.] NCAR Climate & Global Dynam Div, Boulder, CO USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Seidel, DJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Air Resources Lab R ARL, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",dian.seidel@noaa.gov,"Golaz, Jean-Christophe/D-5007-2014","Golaz, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-1616-5435; Zhang, Yehui/0000-0002-1448-0119",National Science Foundation; NSF Office of Polar Programs; Office of Polar Programs (OPP) [0902065] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Office of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Polar Programs (OPP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank Journal of Climate Editor Robert Wood and two anonymous referees, who provided thorough and thoughtful reviews of this paper.

This has enabled developing nations to monitor their environments with more economical options. The environmental monitoring network of Sri Lanka is mainly handled by the government bodies such as Meteorological Department, Irrigation Department and Central Environmental Authority. Most of the systems are manually operated and sparsely distributed. The automated systems are restricted to certain main cities of the country. Thus, the data provided by the existing network not capable enough to generate reliable climate or disaster specific forecasts. The available data is mostly retained as hard copies and they are not freely and publicly available. Hence, every time, the researchers and decision makers need to purchase data and required to undergo redundant data collection procedures. In this context, the 4ONSE research project on developing an experimental, open-source, low cost and non-conventional Environmental Monitoring System (EMS) can be considered as the 1st initiative in Sri Lanka which creates a new revolution in the country for environmental data viewing and sharing without any charge. 4ONSE is the acronym for 4 times Open and Non-Conventional technology for Sensing the Environment, which is a joint research between University of Moratuwa and University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI). Deduru Oya river basin area is the selected study area to deploy the 4ONSE systems. The Deduru Oya is 115km long and covers 2687km2 of catchment area. It carries flash floods during rainy seasons and very low flow during the dry seasons. Hence, the selected case study area is ideal for developing any forecasting application based on the real time environmental data. The project team has already deployed 27 systems in the basin. Temperature, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, wind speed and direction are the parameters measured by the system. In this research we attempt to present the state of the art of open source based environmental monitoring, architecture of the 4ONSE system, motivations behind deployment of the 4ONSE system and finally the lessons for the future research and development.","[Sudantha, B.

Recently, systems made out of new materials have come to the market and extend the stock. The distribution of those different winter cover types in Europe seems to reflect local traditions. Here, the different seasonal shelter types are presented, differentiated and evaluated, and important recommendations given for decision making on the application of protective winter covers. New environmental measurement data, inspection of different materials in use, considerations, modelling and conclusions on the first ventilation measurements and recommendations about the definition of the macroclimate in the shelters are presented.

This opens the possibility to compare the trend to the warming predicted by comprehensive climate models (GCMs), which up to now could not be verified directly to observations on a local scale, because the signal-to-noise ratio was too low. The observed temperature trend in western Europe over the last decades appears much stronger than simulated by state-of-the-art GCMs. The difference is very unlikely due to random fluctuations, either in fast weather processes or in decadal climate fluctuations. In winter and spring, changes in atmospheric circulation are important; in spring and summer changes in soil moisture and cloud cover. A misrepresentation of the North Atlantic Current affects trends along the coast. Many of these processes ontinue to affect trends in projections for the 21st century. This implies that climate predictions for western Europe probably underestimate the effects of anthropogenic climate change.","[van Oldenborgh, G.

The potential culprit insects are diverse and vary with geography. The incidence of insect allergy is declining in some areas and increasing in others, possibly due to effects of climate change, introduction of species into new areas, outdoor recreational activities, and movement of human populations that brings insects into contact with a greater number of people. Flying Hymenoptera and imported fire ant stings are responsible for the majority of patients evaluated for insect anaphylaxis. The most efficient means of identifying allergy to insects is skin testing although falsely positive and negative results occur. The limitations of testing coupled with the natural temporal variability of allergic sensitivity complicate the interpretation of test results. The clinical history is of paramount importance to be certain that the test results are relevant; therefore, screening or testing before a history of a sting reaction is not advisable. Mast cell disorders are associated with severe anaphylaxis from insect stings and should be considered in affected subjects. Insect immunotherapy, using venoms for most insects and whole-body extracts for imported fire ants, is proven effective in reducing the likelihood of anaphylaxis due to subsequent stings from 40%-60% to less than 5%. Future clinical application of component testing or in vitro cellular tests, such as the basophil activation test, may improve optimal choices for immunotherapy.

(in preparation), discusses the relative potentials, advantages and shortcomings of spatial and non spatial models of chemical fate, highlighting that spatially explicit models may be needed for specific purposes. The present paper reviews the state of the art in spatially explicit chemical fate and transport modeling in Europe. We summarize the three main approaches currently adopted in spatially explicit modeling, namely (1) multiple box models, (2) numerical solutions of simultaneous advection-dispersion equations (ADE) in air, soil and water, and (3) the development of meta-models. As all three approaches experience limitations, we describe in further detail geographic information system (GIS)-based modeling as an alternative approach allowing a simple, yet spatially explicit description of chemical fate. We review the input data needed, and the options available for their retrieval at the European scale. We also discuss the importance of, and limitations in model evaluation. We observe that the high uncertainty in chemical emissions and physico-chemical behavior in the environment make realistic simulations difficult to obtain. Therefore we envisage a shift in model use from process simulation to hypothesis testing, in which explaining the discrepancies between observed and computed chemical concentrations in the environment takes importance over prediction per se. This shift may take advantage of using simple models in GIS with residual uses of complex models for detailed studies. It also calls for tighter joint interpretation of models and spatially distributed monitoring datasets, and more refined spatial representation of environmental drivers such as landscape and climate variables, and better emission estimates. In summary, we conclude that the problem is not how to compute (i.e. emphasis on numerical methods, spatial/temporal discretization, quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analysis...) but what to compute (i.e. emphasis on spatial distribution of emissions, and the depiction of appropriate spatial patterns of environmental drivers).

Many case specific valuation studies have been carried out in various parts of theWorld. Yet, a coherent review on the valuation of coastal ecosystem services (CES), which systematically describes fundamental concepts, analyzes reported applications, and addresses the issue of climate change (CC) impacts on the monetary value of CES is still lacking. Here, we take a step towards addressing this knowledge gap by pursuing a coherent review that aims to provide policy makers and researchers in multidisciplinary teams with a summary of the state-of-the-art and a guideline on the process of economic valuation of CES and potential changes in these values due to CC impacts. The article highlights the main concepts of CES valuation studies and offers a systematic analysis of the best practices by analyzing two global scale and 30 selected local and regional case studies, in which different CES have been valued. Our analysis shows that coral reefs and mangroves are among the most frequently valued ecosystems, while sea-grass beds are the least considered ones. Currently, tourism and recreation services as well as storm protection are two of the most considered services representing higher estimated value than other CES. In terms of the valuation techniques used, avoided damage, replacement and substitute cost method as well as stated preference method are among the most commonly used valuation techniques. Following the above analysis, we propose a methodological framework that provides step-wise guidance and better insight into the linkages between climate change impacts and the monetary value of CES. This highlights two main types of CC impacts on CES: one being the climate regulation services of coastal ecosystems, and the other being the monetary value of services, which is subject to substantial uncertainty. Finally, a systematic four-step approach is proposed to effectively monetize potential CC driven variations in the value of CES.","[Mehvar, Seyedabdolhossein; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Mehvar, Seyedabdolhossein; Dastgheib, Ali; van Steveninck, Erik de Ruyter; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Syst Management & Leadership, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Twente; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Twente; University of Technology Sydney; Deltares; University of Queensland,"Mehvar, S (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.;Mehvar, S (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands.",s.mehvar@utwente.nl; t.filatova@utwente.nl; a.dastgheib@un-ihe.org; e.deruijtervansteveninck@un-ihe.org; r.ranasinghe@un-ihe.org,"de Ruyter van Steveninck, Erik D/M-7540-2013; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016; Ranasinghe, Roshanka/C-6711-2009; Dastgheib, Ali/M-8982-2013","de Ruyter van Steveninck, Erik D/0000-0001-5275-1189; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930; Ranasinghe, Roshanka/0000-0001-6234-2063; Dastgheib, Ali/0000-0002-5914-7213",AXA Research Fund; Ministry I&M-IHE Delft cooperation program; Deltares Strategic Research Programme 'Coastal and Offshore Engineering',AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Ministry I&M-IHE Delft cooperation program; Deltares Strategic Research Programme 'Coastal and Offshore Engineering',Authors are thankful for the financial support from the AXA Research Fund and the Ministry I&M-IHE Delft cooperation program.

This study quantifies the historical impact of ENSO on seasonal precipitation through an update of the global ENSO teleconnection maps of Mason and Goddard. Many additional teleconnections are detected due to better handling of missing values and 20 years of additional, higher quality data. These global teleconnection maps are used as deterministic and probabilistic empirical seasonal forecasts in a verification study. The probabilistic empirical forecast model outperforms climatology in the tropics demonstrating the value of a forecast derived from the expected precipitation anomalies given the ENSO phase. Incorporating uncertainty due to SST prediction shows that teleconnection maps are skillful in predicting tropical precipitation up to a lead time of 4 months. The historical IRI seasonal forecasts generally outperform the empirical forecasts made with the teleconnection maps, demonstrating the additional value of state-of-the-art dynamical-based seasonal forecast systems. Additionally, the probabilistic empirical seasonal forecasts are proposed as reference forecasts for future skill assessments of real-time seasonal forecast systems.","[Lenssen, Nathan J.

Brazil is one of the most affected areas in the globe, particularly the Cerrado, a savanna-like biome, whose composition, structure, species abundance and diversity are shaped by recurring fires. The aim is to assess present and future trends of fire danger and burned area (BA), using the Daily Severity Rating (DSR), an extension of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System, and climate outputs from a regional climate model, the RCA4 from the Rossby Centre. To that end, we validated the climate variables simulated by RCA4 and the resulting DSR, both showing consistency with observation-based datasets. We then developed a statistical model of BA using fire season averaged DSR as a predictor, found to explain 71% of the interannual variability of BA from 2003 to 2017. Using the statistical model, we projected future fire danger and BA over Cerrado for IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Results show an increase in future BA for all scenarios, with pronounced changes for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, where BA is expected to increase by 39% and 95% for 2100. In the case of RCP 2.6, the closest scenario to the 1.5 degrees C target established by the United Nations, results indicate an increase in mean BA up to 22% by 2050, compared to the historical period, followed by a decrease to 11% by 2100. This is especially relevant since RCP 2.6 is the only scenario where such a decrease is projected, highlighting the importance of keeping global mean surface temperature below the 1.5 degrees C warming target.","[Silva, Patricia S.; Libonati, Renata; DaCamara, Carlos C.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Dom Luiz, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bastos, Ana] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Libonati, Renata; Rodrigues, Julia A.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Geociencias, Dept Meteorol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade de Lisboa; University of Munich; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Libonati, R (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Dom Luiz, Fac Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal.;Libonati, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Geociencias, Dept Meteorol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,"Libonati, Renata/G-9901-2017; Silva, Patrícia S./AAP-1046-2020; Bastos, Ana/G-2927-2013; DaCamara, Carlos C./A-2555-2013","Libonati, Renata/0000-0001-7570-1993; Silva, Patrícia S./0000-0003-0410-2971; Bastos, Ana/0000-0002-7368-7806; DaCamara, Carlos C./0000-0003-1699-9886","FCT; FAPESP [FAPESP/1389/2014, 2014/20042-2]; Serrapilheira Institute [Serra-1708-15159]; CNPQ [441971/2018-0, 305159/2018-6]",FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Serrapilheira Institute; CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This work was developed within the framework of the Brazilian Fire-Land-Atmosphere System (BrFLAS) Project financed by the Portuguese and Brazilian science foundations, FCT and FAPESP (project references FAPESP/1389/2014 and 2014/20042-2).

Empirical and process-based models differ in their scale and mechanistic assumptions, giving divergent predictions of fire drivers and extent. Although humans have historically used and managed fires, the current role of anthropogenic drivers of fires remains less quantified. Whereas patterns in fire-climate interactions are consistent across the globe, fire-human-vegetation relationships vary strongly by region. Taking a data-driven approach, we use an artificial neural network to learn region-specific relationships between fire and its socio-environmental drivers across the globe. As a result, our models achieve higher predictability as compared to many state-of-the-art fire models, with global spatial correlation of 0.92, monthly temporal correlation of 0.76, interannual correlation of 0.69, and grid-cell level correlation of 0.60, between predicted and observed burned area. Given the current socio-anthropogenic conditions, Equatorial Asia, southern Africa, and Australia show a strong sensitivity of burned area to temperature whereas northern Africa shows a strong negative sensitivity. Overall, forests and shrublands show a stronger sensitivity of burned area to temperature compared to savannas, potentially weakening their status as carbon sinks under future climate-change scenarios.","[Joshi, Jaideep; Sukumar, Raman] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Joshi, Jaideep; Sukumar, Raman] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Joshi, J; Sukumar, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.;Joshi, J; Sukumar, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",jaideepjoshi@iisc.ac.in; rsuku@iisc.ac.in,,,"Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India","Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India","The MODIS datasets used in this study were acquired from the Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System (LAADS) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), located in the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland (https://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/).RS was a JC Bose National Fellow during the tenure of this study.

A significant temporal evolution of the concept can be also tracked with a focus on specific aspects of the sustainability concept in different periods of time. The analysis can help in defining more rigorous evaluation categories and criteria for neighbourhoods sustainability rating systems: new criteria should be included and an international homogenization is recommended in the definition of a common scheme of macro-categories, as well as local versions of the tools.

In general, the simulation of ENSO has improved in the present generation of climate models, with respect to previous generations, and the evolution of the upper ocean heat content is consistent with some of the leading dynamical paradigms. Unrealistic features of the model ENSO include the spatial structure of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variations, as well as the time evolution of interannual variability. Standard deviations of interannual SST anomalies do not maximize close to the western coast of South America, as found in nature, and extend too far west along the equator. In most of the models included in this study, ENSO events occur more frequently and more regularly than they do in nature. The comparison of two climate models with different dominant ENSO time scales, one longer and closer to observations and the other much shorter than observed, shows that the spatial structure of the anomalous wind stress during ENSO events, in particular the meridional scale of the zonal wind stress anomalies, may play a key role in setting the ENSO time scale.","[Capotondi, Antonietta] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, PSD, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Capotondi, Antonietta] CIRES, Climate Diagnost Ctr, Boulder, CO USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Capotondi, A (corresponding author), NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, PSD, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",Antonietta.Capotondi@noaa.gov,,,,,,,39,5,5,0,6,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0065-8448,,978-0-87590-480-1,GEOPHYS MONOGR SER,,,2010,,,,,105,122,,10.1029/2008GM000796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GM000796,10.1029/GM189,,18,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BUS84,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290244800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temporal declines in speciation rates have often been interpreted as the effect of ecological limits, competition, and diversity dependence, emphasising the role of biotic factors. Abiotic factors, such as climate change, are also supposed to have affected diversification rates over geological time scales, yet direct tests of these presumed effects have mainly been limited to few clades well represented in the fossil record. If warmer climatic periods have sustained faster speciation, this could explain slowdowns in speciation during the Cenozoic climate cooling. Here, we apply state-of-the art diversity-dependent and temperature-dependent phylogenetic models of diversification to 218 tetrapod families, along with constant rate and time-dependent models. We confirm the prevalence of diversification slowdowns, and find as much support for temperature-dependent than diversity-dependent models. These results call for a better integration of these two processes in studies of diversification dynamics.","[Condamine, Fabien L.] CNRS, UMR 5554, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Condamine, Fabien L.; Rolland, Jonathan; Morlon, Helene] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, UMR 7641, Ctr Math Appl, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Rolland, Jonathan] Univ Lausanne, Biophore, Dept Computat Biol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rolland, Jonathan] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Univ Blvd 4200-6270, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Morlon, Helene] PSL Res Univ, CNRS, INSERM, IBENS,Dept Biol,Ecole Normale Super, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; University of Lausanne; University of British Columbia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Universite Paris Cite,"Condamine, FL (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5554, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier, France.;Condamine, FL (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech, CNRS, UMR 7641, Ctr Math Appl, Route Saclay, F-91128 Palaiseau, France.",fabien.condamine@gmail.com,,"Morlon, Helene/0000-0002-3195-7521",EU [IOF-627684]; Banting postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia [151042]; French National Research Agency [ANR ECOEVOBIO-CHEX2011]; European Research Council (ERC-CoG-PANDA),EU(European Commission); Banting postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia; French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)); European Research Council (ERC-CoG-PANDA),"We are grateful to Rampal Etienne, Albert Phillimore and two anonymous reviewers for insightful comments on the study.

In order to explore the planting types of extensive green roof suitable for warm temperate semi humid region, 12 plant species and 5 planting substrates were selected to conduct the experiment on the roof of the Architectural Art Museum (36 degrees 40'37N, 117 degrees 11'25E) of Shandong Jianzhu University, Licheng District, Jinan City, Shandong Province, China in March to October in 2019, and each plant species was planted on 5 planting substrates on the roof, respectively. By measuring the basic foundation layer load parameters, substrate bulk density and plant unit weight in the process of construction, the increase of planting weight load bearing capacity was calculated. After 4 weeks, the plant physiological indexes were tested. Finally, based on fuzzy mathematics subordinate function value method, combined with the plant physiological indexes, all combination types were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that the unit weight of 12 plant species was divided into three categories, and the change trend of the weight load bearing capacity increase of each plant combined with the five planting substrates was similar to that of the five planting substrates. According to the comprehensive evaluation, 12 planting combinations were considered to be suitable for application on the extensive green roofs in warm temperate semi- humid areas. Compared with the plant weight, in the early stage of extensive green roof construction, the weight of planting substrate is the main factor leading to the change of weight load bearing capacity increase.","[Li, Guirong; Zhang, Peng; Chen, Qiang] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhi] Shandong Yicheng Ecol Technol Co Ltd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong Jianzhu University,"Chen, Q (corresponding author), Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",chdchysd@gmail.com,,,"Shandong Natural Science Foundation Committee [2019GSF110001]; Department of Housing and Urban-Rural of Shandong Province, China [2018-K1-02]","Shandong Natural Science Foundation Committee; Department of Housing and Urban-Rural of Shandong Province, China","The authors would like to thank Shandong Natural Science Foundation Committee (No. 2019GSF110001) and the Department of Housing and Urban-Rural of Shandong Province (No. 2018-K1-02), China for their financial supports.",,56,0,0,0,0,HARD,OLSZTYN 5,"POST-OFFICE BOX, 10-718 OLSZTYN 5, POLAND",1230-1485,2083-5906,,POL J ENVIRON STUD,Pol.

The covariability of IOD and ENSO is analyzed by applying the extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) method to the surface and subsurface ocean temperatures in the tropical Indian Ocean and western Pacific. The first EEOF mode shows the evolution of IOD that lags ENSO, whereas the second mode exhibits the transition from a dipole mode to a basin-wide mode in the tropical Indian Ocean that leads ENSO. The lead-lag relationships between IOD and ENSO are consistent with two-way interactions between them. A comparison between two 500-year model simulations with and without ENSO shows that ENSO can enhance the variability of IOD at interannual time scale. The influence of ENSO on the IOD intensity is larger for the eastern pole than for the western pole, and further, is stronger in the negative IOD phase than in the positive phase. The influence of IOD on ENSO is demonstrated by the improvement of ENSO prediction using sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Indian Ocean as an ENSO precursor. The improvement of the ENSO forecast skill is found at both a short lead time (0 month) and long leads (10-15 months). The SST in the western pole has more predictive value than in the eastern pole. The eastward propagation of surface and subsurface temperature signals from the western Indian Ocean that precedes the development of heat content anomaly in the tropical western Pacific is the key for extending the lead time for ENSO prediction. Our results are consistent with previously reported findings but highlight the spatial-temporal evolution of the ENSO-IOD system. It is also illustrated that IOD would have been more helpful in predicting the 1997/98 El Nino than the 2015/16 El Nino.","[Wang, Hui; Kumar, Arun; Narapusetty, Balachandrudu] NOAA, NWS, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr,NCWCP, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Murtugudde, Raghu; Narapusetty, Balachandrudu] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Narapusetty, Balachandrudu] Innovim, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Seip, Knut L.] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, OsloMet, Fac Technol Art & Design, Oslo, Norway",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Wang, H (corresponding author), NOAA, NWS, NCEP, Climate Predict Ctr,NCWCP, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",hui.wang@noaa.gov,", AK/B-6517-2008",,,,,,76,33,33,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Subsequent hydration of lime would lead to the synthesis of slaked/hydrated lime Ca(OH)(2); the production of a tonne of Ca(OH)(2) emits similar to 1.2 tonnes of CO2 arising mainly from the process chemistry and fossil fuel combustion. Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) technologies are currently believed to have the highest potential to mitigate these CO2 emissions, assuming that the thermal calcination of CaCO3 is unavoidable. Despite intensive research efforts and development, CCS technologies cannot be industrially applied yet due to their limited efficiency and the associated capital and operational costs. In this review, the current state of the lime industry and its processing configurations is visualised. This is followed by a detailed description of the current status of the relevant CCS technologies (including their CO2 avoidance costs) and eco-efficient alternative fuels. This work then gives voice to two novel and potentially more sustainable decarbonisation mutes that do not involve the thermal calcination of CaCO3, one of which involves simultaneous mineralisation leading to permanent storage of CO2. These technologies are particularly interesting especially if high temperature lime kilns, as we know them, are phased out to meet climate goals. It is revealed that the energy shift to green electricity might lead to a no-carbon lime industry and subsequent carbon neutrality (or negativity) of other hard-to-abate sectors.","[Simoni, Marco; Provis, John L.; Kinoshita, Hajime; Hanein, Theodore] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, England; [Wilkes, Mathew D.; Brown, Solomon] Univ Sheffield, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Simoni, M; Hanein, T (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, England.",marco.simoni.w@gmail.com; t.hanein@sheffield.ac.uk,"; Provis, John/A-7631-2008","Hanein, Theodore/0000-0002-3009-703X; Simoni, Marco/0000-0001-5248-851X; Kinoshita, Hajime/0000-0001-8805-1774; Provis, John/0000-0003-3372-8922; Wilkes, Mathew Dennis/0000-0003-0842-787X",UKRI Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/R025959/1]; EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Carbon Capture and Storage and Cleaner Fossil Energy [EP/L016362/1],UKRI Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Carbon Capture and Storage and Cleaner Fossil Energy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was funded by the UKRI Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC; EP/R025959/1) and CEMEX.

This paper summarizes the key issues and then derives guidance for developing, selecting, and applying the estimates that follows from the fundamental scientific nature and economic principles associated with GHGs and climate change, as well as an understanding of the state of the art for estimating the SCC. The paper evaluates recent estimates in light of the guidance and finds the estimates inconsistent with the guidance in a number of significant areas. The paper also differentiates SCC policy applications in terms of policies with incremental versus nonincremental implications for global GHGs, and identifies serious issues for application of the SCC in setting and evaluating climate policy targets.

Emerging new GPP products with higher spatial and temporal resolutions (500-1000 m, 8-day) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Photosynthesis (MOD17), the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) models, provided unprecedented opportunities to understand the spatial and temporal variations of GPP. However, their performances under drought conditions remain obscure. Here we evaluated the performance of these four state-of-the-art GPP products in grasslands, using FLUXNET data as reference. The results showed that all the four models have reasonable accuracies under non-drought years. In drought years, the VPM performed best, followed by the MOD17, PML and BESS, with the RMSEs of 1.67, 1.69, 1.72 and 1.77 gC m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The VPM, BESS and PML overestimated annual GPP by 2%, 13% and 21%, respectively, while MOD17 underestimated annual GPP by 10% in drought years. This varied model performances under drought years could be partially attributed to the differences in quantifying the water stress effects. The water constraint factor in the VPM, which is derived from the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and directly indicates the overall water content of leaf, plant stand and soil background, could better capture the vegetation response to water content variation than that in MOD17, PML and BESS, all of which used an atmospheric moisture related indicator (the Vapor Pressure Deficit for MOD17 and PML, and the relative humidity for BESS). This study suggests that water stress factors, which reflect the physiological and ecological characteristics of vegetation itself (e.g., LSWI) rather than atmospheric moisture (e.g., VPD) or other meteorological surrogates, should be further considered in GPP models when applied in drought conditions","[Pei, Yanyan; Dong, Jinwei; Yang, Jilin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jilin; Xiao, Xiangming] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Spatial Anal, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhang, Yao] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Zhang, Yongqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Chongya] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Landscape Architecture & Rural Syst Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Columbia University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Seoul National University (SNU)","Xiao, XM (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Spatial Anal, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Dong, JW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",peiyy@igsnrr.ac.cn; dongjw@igsnrr.ac.cn; xiangming.xiao@ou.edu,"YONGQIANG, ZHANG/C-5708-2008; xiao, xiang/GWU-6035-2022; Zhang, Yao/P-2009-2015; Dong, Jinwei/C-4949-2009","YONGQIANG, ZHANG/0000-0002-3562-2323; Zhang, Yao/0000-0002-7468-2409; Dong, Jinwei/0000-0001-5687-803X; Xiao, Xiangming/0000-0003-0956-7428","Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China [XDA19040301]","Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This study is funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program (XDA19040301) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China.

This paper investigates a number of challenges of Interdisciplinary collaborations in implementation of a circular economy approach within textile and graphic designs. These challenges range from achieving economy of scale required for commercial viability and finding secondary markets for the recycled materials to developing 'resource efficient recycling processes' that are especially tailored to the specific needs of eco-friendly textile products. Art Education Department at Sultan Qaboos University created interdisciplinary education strategy through an artistic relevant, and engaging the textile printing and graphic design courses in a project. The aim of this project is to apply some natural waste products which contain pigments to be served as recycling sources for natural dyes in textile coloration regarding their increasing interest due to their biodegradability and environmental awareness. The research project was divided in two parts; part one depends on studying the optimum condition of extraction with different co-solvent on different textile fabrics, as the extraction can be an energy, economic and environmental friendly by waste recycling. Part two deals on studying the mixing of the resulted extractions in producing a variety of hues under the effect of different pH values, mordants and mordanting methods to promote artistic printed textile patterns assisted by the graphic design. Therefore, students are introduced to different and integrated ways of thinking, aiming to make them more aware of circular economy and sustainability issues in all of their art activities, from personal to professional environments. As a result, this research is considered as a double scientific leap in terms of development strategies for teaching art curricula through the Multidisciplinary Integration in serving the community and the environment.

The experimental research was conducted in two stages. During the first stage of research a total of 267 university teachers who volunteered to participate in the research were interviewed for eliciting information concerning their participation activity rate in specially focused network pedagogical communities. During the second stage 108 university teachers selected from the total population by homogeneous sampling completed a questionnaire on teacher self-efficacy developed by A. Bandura. Although the findings of the study show that not all university teachers believe that there is a clear link between networked professional learning and high level of university teachers' self-efficacy, the majority of respondents recognize the increasing influence of informal learning in general and networked professional learning in particular on their professional growth.

There is a growing interest in understanding habitat suitability and future distributions of species in the scientific world. Because climate change has impacted ecosystems with major consequences, species are shifting and declining much faster than in the past. Some global climate models used for predicting climate in the future better represent and have higher reliability for some climate types. Ferulago glareosa, which lives in Turkey, is a rare endemic plant species. In this study, we investigated current and future distributions of the species determined to be habitat-specific to lead to future studies on conservation. The Maxent model was used to map the current and future potential distribution of the species for Turkey. HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-LR global climate models based on predicted future suitability of E glareosa for 2050 and 2070 were examined. Models were constructed based on 20 presence points of the species and 2 abiotic variables. The current species distribution modeling of Ferulago glareosa predicted by the model produced very high success rates with training and test AUC values of 0.970 and 0.968, respectively. The true skill statistics value of the model (0.8245) indicated excellent model performance. In the end, we have demonstrated how predictions obtained from a highly reliable global climate model for a region's climate could provide more dependable insights into the future distribution of narrow-spread endemic species.","[Sari, Idris] Erzincan Social Sci High Sch, Erzincan, Turkey; [Kandemir, Ali] Erzincan Binali Yildirim Univ, Fac Art & Sci, Dept Biol, Erzincan, Turkey",Erzincan Binali Yildirim University,"Sari, I (corresponding author), Erzincan Social Sci High Sch, Erzincan, Turkey.",botanical24@gmail.com,"SARI, İdris/AAY-4955-2020","SARI, İdris/0000-0003-2475-8759",Erzincan Binali Yildirim University BAP Unit's funds [FEN-A-080715-0158],Erzincan Binali Yildirim University BAP Unit's funds,"This work was supported by the Erzincan Binali Yildirim University BAP Unit's funds (Project No. FEN-A-080715-0158).

J,"Philpott, C",,,,"Philpott, Carolyn",,,Sonic Explorations of the Southernmost Continent: Four composers' responses to Antarctica and climate change in the twenty-first century,ORGANISED SOUND,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SCIENCE; ICE; HISTORY,"Composers have been drawn to the world's southernmost continent, Antarctica, for creative inspiration since the so-called Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration' in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However, it has only been since the final few years of the twentieth century that professional composers have had opportunities to travel to the far south as part of arts residency programmes to experience its environment - and its unique soundscapes - first-hand. Most composers who have visited Antarctica to date have utilised sound recording technologies to document their journeys sonically and have subsequently created compositions that feature their soundscape recordings. Typically, such compositions include biological sounds, such as vocalisations of penguins and seals (both on the ice and underwater); non-biological or geophysical' ambient sounds that emanate from the natural landscape, such as those created by wind, blizzards, and ice cracking and calving; and/or anthropogenic (human) sounds recorded within the Antarctic environment. This article examines a series of recent compositions by four established composers who have visited Antarctica and used their experiences and field recordings to inform their creative work: Douglas Quin, Jay Needham, Lawrence English and Philip Samartzis. The primary aim of this research is to investigate what these composers' Antarctica-related works reveal about their individual encounters with and perceptions of the frozen continent, as well as to consider the role of such compositions in conveying messages related to climate change to listeners around the globe - the vast majority of whom are unlikely to ever see or hear the place in person.","[Philpott, Carolyn] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Coll Arts, Conservatorium Mus, Private Bag 63, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Philpott, C (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Coll Arts, Conservatorium Mus, Private Bag 63, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Carolyn.Philpott@utas.edu.au,,"Philpott, Carolyn/0000-0002-5778-5748",,,,,48,7,7,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1355-7718,1469-8153,,ORGAN SOUND,Organ.

In the scientific field, different analytical techniques have been used for the characterization of different pigments present in the pictographs from rock shelter paintings. Example of this are the Inkaterra rock shelter paintings, which are placed in one of the most impressive and unknown natural setting, located in the town of Aguas Calientes, belonging to the lands of the Hotel Machupicchu Pueblo, forming part of Machupicchu Archaeological Park (Peru) and are composed by many different geometric pictographs. In this work, apart from micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled to Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (SEM-EDS) have been used to ascertain the molecular and elemental composition of the rock substrate as well as of the different pigments used to create the pictographs visible on the Inkaterra rock shelter. In this sense, black, red and orange pigments were analyzed, identifying the use of carbon, hematite and beta-carotene respectively. Thus, thanks to this work it has been demonstrated that the orange color was not present in the original painting, but it is caused due to microbiological colonizations favored by the climate conditions of the area.

Cyclone tracks were generated from two free-runs from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System (CFSv1) model for the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and compared with cyclone tracks generated from CFS reanalysis and ERA Interim data from 1979 to 2016. It is demonstrated that CFSv1 is capable of simulating realistic SH cyclone track climatology for both intensity and frequency. The CFSv1's ability to capture interannual variability is also highlighted. Specifically, the impacts of the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on cyclone track frequency and intensity were assessed. The CFSv1 exhibits an annular structure in frequency and intensity in response to the AAO. For the reanalysis data, AAO cyclone frequency is less annular in the South Pacific especially during Austral Summer, possibly due to a positive trend in the AAO in recent decades. To test this, a reconstruction of cyclone tracks for ERA40 data from 1958 to 2001 produces a more annular structure. The response of cyclone tracks due to ENSO is fairly robust, with the reanalysis datasets and one member of the CFSv1 producing a pattern of cyclone variability consistent with the Pacific South American teleconnection pattern. In contrast, the cyclone frequency and intensity response to the IOD shows little agreement between reanalysis and CFSv1. An examination of 200-hPa stream function supports the CFS model producing a teleconnection response to ENSO but not the IOD, possibly due to anomalous heating generated from the IOD being too small. Our results suggest that assessing interannual variability of cyclone tracks in current state-of-the-art models be done with large-number ensembles when possible, especially when considering sensitivity to initial conditions and the magnitude of external forcing.","[Eichler, Timothy P.] Univ Arkansas, Eleanor Mann Sch Nursing, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Eichler, Timothy P.; Market, Patrick] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Eichler, TP (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Eleanor Mann Sch Nursing, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",tpeichle@uark.edu,"Market, Patrick Shawn/AGO-5184-2022; Eichler, Timothy/A-5040-2015","Market, Patrick Shawn/0000-0002-5574-319X; Eichler, Timothy/0000-0003-0342-9681","Directorate for Geosciences, EPSCoR","Directorate for Geosciences, EPSCoR","Directorate for Geosciences, Grant/Award Number: EPSCoR",,70,1,1,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In the 21st century, the concept of pavement design and rehabilitation needs to be modified owing to new requirements such as the additional structural loads derived from the climate change, environmental challenges, social requirements, and aging population. Therefore, the concept of post-modern pavement (PMP) was proposed to address the structural, sustainability, and sociopsychological requirements. In this review of the state-of-the-art, the potential of the interlocking concrete block pavement (ICBP) was evaluated based on its laboratory and field structural performance, sustainability, and social acceptance as a PMP in Japan. Therefore, the relevant literature in English and Japanese, including journals, conference proceedings, technical reports, books, and theses, over a span of 47 years (1971-2018), were studied. It was found that the structural and functional performances of the ICBP in different facilities were satisfying. Furthermore, owing to its waste material use, less noise emission, air purifying characteristics, and heat island reduction, the environmental performance of ICBP was in harmony with sustainable practices. In addition, pavements users, both able and differently abled, rated the ICBP as a more appropriate pavement system owing to its physical appearance, serviceability, aesthetic features, lower heat island effect, rapid maintenance, and positive psychologic effects after earthquake and tsunami events. As a result, the ICBP can be recommended as a PMP for the design and development of resilient transportation infrastructure assets in Japan. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These abiotic factors govern the synthesis and degradation of primary (sugars, amino acids, organic acids, etc.) and secondary (phenolic and volatile flavor compounds and their precursors) metabolites directly, via the regulation of their biosynthetic pathways, or indirectly, via their effects on vine physiology and phenology. Several hundred secondary metabolites have been identified in the grape berry. Their biosynthesis and degradation have been characterized and have been shown to occur during different developmental stages of the berry. The understanding of how the different abiotic factors modulate secondary metabolism and thus berry quality is of crucial importance for breeders and growers to develop plant material and viticultural practices to maintain high-quality fruit and wine production in the context of global warming. Here, we review the main secondary metabolites of the grape berry, their biosynthesis, and how their accumulation and degradation is influenced by abiotic factors. The first part of the review provides an update on structure, biosynthesis, and degradation of phenolic compounds (flavonoids and non-flavonoids) and major aroma compounds (terpenes, thiols, methoxypyrazines, and C13 norisoprenoids). The second part gives an update on the influence of abiotic factors, such as water availability, temperature, radiation, and CO2 concentration, on berry secondary metabolism. At the end of the paper, we raise some critical questions regarding intracluster berry heterogeneity and dilution effects and how the sampling strategy can impact the outcome of studies on the grapevine berry response to abiotic factors.","[Rienth, Markus; Vigneron, Nicolas] Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Oenol, Nyon, Switzerland; [Darriet, Philippe] INRAE, Unite Rech Enol, EA 4577, USC 1366, Bordeaux, France; [Darriet, Philippe] Inst Sci Vigne & Vin, CS 50008, Villenave Dornon, France; [Sweetman, Crystal] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Burbidge, Crista] CSIRO, Agr & Food, Glen Osmond, SA, Australia; [Bonghi, Claudio] Univ Padova Agripolis, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Legnaro, Italy; [Walker, Robert Peter; Famiani, Franco] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, Perugia, Italy; [Castellarin, Simone Diego] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Wine Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada",INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Flinders University South Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Padua; University of Perugia; University of British Columbia,"Rienth, M (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Oenol, Nyon, Switzerland.",markus.rienth@changins.ch,"Burbidge, Crista Ann/H-2784-2013; bonghi, claudio/F-3738-2017; Darriet, Philippe/AAC-9989-2022; Famiani, Franco/L-9202-2015","Burbidge, Crista Ann/0000-0002-1377-4393; Darriet, Philippe/0000-0002-7202-8710; Famiani, Franco/0000-0002-9634-7951; Rienth, Markus/0000-0002-6302-6297; Sweetman, Crystal/0000-0002-7922-8205",Swiss National Science Fondation (SNF) [IZCOZ0_189896],Swiss National Science Fondation (SNF),The post-doc of NV was financed by the Swiss National Science Fondation (SNF) Project Grant IZCOZ0_189896.,,362,32,32,56,157,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

The results show that in the mid-21st century all three types of HWs in China will occur more frequently with strengthened intensity and elongated duration relative to the PD. The compound HWs will change most dramatically, with the frequency in the FP being 4-5 times that in the PD, and the intensity and duration doubling those in the PD. The changes in daytime and nighttime HWs are also remarkable, with the changes of nighttime HWs larger than those of daytime HWs. The future changes of the three types of HWs in China in two models are similar in terms of spatial patterns and area-averaged quantities, indicating these projected changes of HWs over the China under RCP4.5 scenario are robust. Further analyses suggest that projected future changes in HWs over China are determined mainly by the increase in seasonal mean surface air temperatures with change in temperature variability playing a minor role. The seasonal mean temperature increase is due to the increase in surface downward longwave radiation and surface shortwave radiation. The increase in downward longwave radiation results from the enhanced greenhouse effect and increased water vapour in the atmosphere. The increase in surface shortwave radiation is the result of the decreased aerosol emissions, via direct aerosolradiation interaction and indirect aerosol-cloud interaction over southeastern and northeastern China, and the reduced cloud cover related to a decrease in relative humidity.","[Su, Qin] Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Dong, Buwen] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci Climate, Reading, Berks, England",Yunnan University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Su, Q (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",suqin@ynu.edu.cn,,"Su, Qin/0000-0001-9707-5153","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41505037, 41875103]; Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province [2016FB078]; UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China, Newton Fund; China Scholarship Council; U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province; UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China, Newton Fund; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 41505037 and 41875103, by the Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FB078), and by the UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund.

Modem instruments allow single particles to be analyzed one-by-one in real time, and offer the promise of determining the sources of individual particles based on their mass spectral signatures. The large number of particles to be apportioned makes clustering a necessary step. The goal of this study is to compare using mass spectral data the accuracy and speed of several clustering algorithms: ART-2a, several variants of hierarchical clustering, and K-means. Repeated simulations with various algorithms and different levels of data preprocessing suggest that hierarchical clustering methods using derivatives of Ward's algorithm discriminate sources with fewer errors than ART-2a, which itself discriminates much better than point-wise hierarchical clustering methods. In most cases, K-means algorithms do almost as well as the best hierarchical clustering. These efficient algorithms (clustering derived from Ward's algorithm, ART-2a and K-means) are most accurate when the relative peak areas have been pre-scaled by taking the square root. Analysis times vary within a factor of 30, and when accuracy above 95% is required, run times scale up as the square of the number of particles. Algorithms derived from Ward's remain the most accurate under a wide range of conditions and conversely, for an equal accuracy, can deliver a shorter list of clusters, allowing faster and maybe on-the-fly classification.

However, these numerical simulators produce outputs with low spatial resolution that exhibit difficulties representing precipitation events accurately. This is mainly due to computational limitations on the spatial resolution used when simulating multi-scale weather dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using input data from a reanalysis product, that is comparable to a climate model's output, but can be directly related to precipitation observations at a given time and location. Further, our input excludes local precipitation, but includes model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable and generalizable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We also propose a non-stochastic variant of the conditional-continuous (CC) loss function to capture the zero-skewed patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our models, trained with our CC loss, consistently attain lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in precipitation downscaling and outperform a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various data formulation strategies, for the training and test sets, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.","[Adewoyin, Rilwan A.; He, Yulan] Univ Warwick, Dept Comp Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Adewoyin, Rilwan A.] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Dueben, Peter] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Earth Syst Modelling Sect, Reading, Berks, England; [Watson, Peter] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Dutta, Ritabrata] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick; Southern University of Science & Technology; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Bristol; University of Warwick,"Adewoyin, RA (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Comp Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;Adewoyin, RA (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",rilwan.adewoyin@warwick.ac.uk,"dutta, ritabrata/GWC-8579-2022; dutta, ritabrata/AAZ-4467-2021","dutta, ritabrata/0000-0001-8209-7747; Watson, Peter/0000-0001-5173-9903; Adewoyin, Rilwan/0000-0003-4703-7938",Alan Turing Institute; HPC Facilities at the University of Warwick (Orac cluster); Royal Society; European Union [823988]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/S014713/1]; UK Research and Innovation [EP/V020579/1],Alan Turing Institute; HPC Facilities at the University of Warwick (Orac cluster); Royal Society(Royal Society of London); European Union(European Commission); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"The project was funded by Alan Turing Institute under Climate Action Pilot Projects Call.

Research on single-family VIS reported very hot thermal sensations with the PMV-PPD model in hot weather. The objective of the present research is to complement the state of the art by evaluating the thermal environment of a multifamily SIV with two different comfort models: 1) the PMV-PPD and 2) the adaptive model. The methodology had two phases: 1) monitoring of a VIS environment, and 2) assessment using the two models mentioned above. The results indicated thermal dissatisfaction due to excess heat with both models during daytime hours, very similar to what has been reported in the state of the art for single-family typology. However, a 35% saving in energy dedicated to air conditioning was also found if evaluated with the adaptive model. The absence of solar protection in openings was evidenced, and the high values of air temperature and mean radiant temperature indicated that the thermal insulation of the vertical envelope of these buildings is insufficient to provide thermal comfort. Passive improvements are proposed to ameliorate the habitability of these dwellings and their mandatory inclusion in Regulation 0549, to reduce energy consumption and its environmental impact.","[Giraldo-Castaneda, Walter] Univ Valle, Fac Artes Integradas, Escuela Arquitectura, Dept Tecnol Construcc, Cali, Colombia; [Daniel Czajkowski, Jorge; Fernanda Gomez, Analia] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Arquitectura & Urbanism, Lab Arquitectura & Habitat Sustentable, La Plata, Argentina",Universidad del Valle; National University of La Plata,"Giraldo-Castaneda, W (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Fac Artes Integradas, Escuela Arquitectura, Dept Tecnol Construcc, Cali, Colombia.",walter.giraldo@correounivalle.edu.co; jdczajko@gmail.com; anygomez@gmail.com,,"Giraldo, Walter/0000-0002-8542-6689; Czajkowski, Jorge Daniel/0000-0001-8857-7880",,,,,28,1,1,4,6,"UNIV CATOLICA COLOMBIA, FAC DISENO",BOGOTA D C,"CARRERA 13 NO 47-49, BOGOTA D C, 00000, COLOMBIA",1657-0308,2357-626X,,REV ARQUIT,Rev.

While his contributions are recognised by an increasing number of modern-day scientists, in the public domain his legacy has been all but forgotten. Popularising Croll's story brings its own challenges: we know more about the science than we do about the man, and his theories do not lend themselves to quick and easy explanation. While Croll's scientific theories, presented alone, risk being viewed as complex and difficult to digest, his lifelong struggle against adversity is a compelling story with the potential for widespread public appeal. In recent years, interested individuals and institutions have begun to increase public awareness of Croll through talks and lectures, exhibitions, theatrical events and articles in print and online. There are many more possibilities that are worth investigating, in order to inspire and engage people locally, nationally and even internationally. Croll's story is fascinating from many points of view, and is open to interpretation by people of different ages and backgrounds. Perhaps even the gaps in our knowledge can be turned to advantage, allowing for imagination, creativity and expression.","[Woolf, Jo] Royal Scottish Geog Soc, Lord John Murray House,15-19 North Port, Perth PH1 5LU, Scotland",,"Woolf, J (corresponding author), Royal Scottish Geog Soc, Lord John Murray House,15-19 North Port, Perth PH1 5LU, Scotland.",enquiries@rsgs.org,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1755-6910,1755-6929,,EARTH ENV SCI T R SO,Earth Environ.

The effects of all anthropogenic aerosols, and anthropogenic black carbon (BC), sulfate, and primary organic matter (POM) are decomposed from different sensitivity simulations. Anthropogenic sulfate and POM reduce the solar flux reaching the surface directly by scattering the solar radiation, and indirectly by increasing the cloud droplet number concentration and cloud liquid water path over East China. The surface air temperature over land is reduced, and the precipitation in North China is suppressed. Unlike anthropogenic sulfate and POM, anthropogenic BC does not have a significant effect on the air temperature at the surface, because of the reduction of the cloud liquid water path and the weakening of shortwave cloud forcing by its semi-direct effect. The anthropogenic BC strengthens the southwesterly wind over South China and leads to stronger deep convection at the 25 degrees N-30 degrees N latitudinal band. The effect of all anthropogenic aerosols on air temperature, clouds, and precipitation is not a linear summation of effects from individual anthropogenic sulfate, BC and POM. Overall all anthropogenic aerosols suppress the precipitation in North China and enhance the precipitation in South China and adjacent ocean regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Heat-island effect, reduced green cover and increasing dependency on fossil fuels for powering air-conditioning, in spite of the availability of local renewable energy sources, have characterized the relatively fast economic development of Mauritius over the past decades. With a very high population density of 617 inhabitants per km(2) and 1 million tourists arriving annually in a land area of only 2040 km(2), the sustainability of buildings in Mauritius is a critical issue. This paper focuses on Energy Management as a holistic tool to achieve sustainability in buildings. Reforms are analyzed in terms of institutional and regulatory framework towards supporting sustainability through Energy Management. The particular case of air-conditioning in buildings is considered, and how it can be avoided, in the context of hot humid climates through natural ventilation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The latter describes the removal of HNO3 from the stratosphere by sedimenting PSC particles, which hinders chlorine deactivation by the formation of reservoir species. Therefore, an accurate representation of PSCs in chemistry- climate models (CCMs) is of great importance to correctly simulate polar ozone concentrations. Here, we evaluate PSCs as simulated by the CCM SOCOLv3.1 for the Antarctic winters 2006, 2007 and 2010 by comparison with backscatter measurements by CALIOP on board the CALIPSO satellite. The year 2007 represents a typical Antarctic winter, while 2006 and 2010 are characterized by above- and below-average PSC occurrence. The model considers supercooled ternary solution (STS) droplets, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, water ice particles and mixtures thereof. PSCs are parameterized in terms of temperature and partial pressures of HNO3 and H2O, assuming equilibrium between the gas and particulate phase. The PSC scheme involves a set of prescribed microphysical parameters, namely ice number density, NAT particle radius and maximum NAT number density. In this study, we test and optimize the parameter settings through several sensitivity simulations. The choice of the value for the ice number density affects simulated optical properties and dehydration, while modifying the NAT parameters impacts stratospheric composition via HNO3 uptake and denitrification. Depending on the NAT parameters, reasonable denitrification can be modeled. However, its im- pact on ozone loss is minor. The best agreement with the CALIOP optical properties and observed denitrification was for this case study found with the ice number density increased from the hitherto used value of 0.01 to 0.05 cm(-3) and the maximum NAT number density from 5 x 10(-4) to 1 x 10(-3) cm(-3). The NAT radius was kept at the original value of 5 mu m. The new parameterization reflects the higher importance attributed to heterogeneous nucleation of ice and NAT particles following recent new data evaluations of the state-of-the-art CALIOP measurements. A cold temperature bias in the polar lower stratosphere results in an overestimated PSC areal coverage in SOCOLv3.1 by up to 40 %. Offsetting this cold bias by +3 K delays the onset of ozone depletion by about 2 weeks, which improves the agreement with observations. Furthermore, the occurrence of mountain-waveinduced ice, as observed mainly over the Antarctic Peninsula, is continuously underestimated in the model due to the coarse model resolution (T42L39) and the fixed ice number density. Nevertheless, we find overall good temporal and spatial agreement between modeled and observed PSC occurrence and composition. This work confirms previous studies indicating that simplified PSC schemes, which avoid nucleation and growth calculations in sophisticated but time-consuming microphysical process models, may also achieve good approximations of the fundamental properties of PSCs needed in CCMs.","[Steiner, Michael; Luo, Beiping; Peter, Thomas; Stenke, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pitts, Michael C.] NASA Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; [Steiner, Michael] Empa, Lab Air Pollut Environm Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA),"Steiner, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Steiner, M (corresponding author), Empa, Lab Air Pollut Environm Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland.",michael.steiner@empa.ch,"Stenke, Andrea/GYJ-6299-2022; Peter, Thomas/B-2529-2018","Peter, Thomas/0000-0002-7218-7156; Stenke, Andrea/0000-0002-5916-4013",,,,,68,2,2,1,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

Organic material preserved in high mountain ice provides rare snapshots into the use of alpine and high altitude zones, which played a central role in the emergence of East Asian pastoralism. Here, we present the results of the first archaeological survey of melting ice margins in the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia, revealing a near-continuous record of more than 3500 years of human activity. Osteology, radiocarbon dating, and collagen fingerprinting analysis of wooden projectiles, animal bone, and other artifacts indicate that big-game hunting and exploitation of alpine ice played a significant role during the emergence of mobile pastoralism in the Altai, and remained a core element of pastoral adaptation into the modern era. Extensive ice melting and loss of wildlife in the study area over recent decades, driven by a warming climate, poaching, and poorly regulated hunting, presents an urgent threat to the future viability of herding lifeways and the archaeological record of hunting in montane zones.","[Taylor, William; Bayarsaikhan, Jamsranjav; Zahir, Muhammad; Petraglia, Michael; Boivin, Nicole] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany; [Taylor, William; Pettigrew, Devin] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hart, Isaac] Univ Utah, Dept Anthropol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Pan, Caleb] Innov8ag Solut, Walla Walla, WA USA; [Bayarsaikhan, Jamsranjav] Nat Museum Mongolia, Ulan Bator, Mongolia; [Murdoch, James] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Wildlife & Fisheries Biol Program, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Caspari, Gino] Univ Bern, Inst Archaeol Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Caspari, Gino] Univ Sydney, Dept Archaeol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Klinge, Michael] Univ Gottingen, Inst Geog, Goldschmidtstr 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Pearson, Kristen] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bikhumar, Umirbyek] Mongolian Altai Rock Art Complex, Preservat Management Off, Bayan Ulgii, Mongolia; [Shnaider, Svetlana] RAS, SB, ArchaeoZOOl Siberia & Cent Asia ZooSCAn, CNRS,Inst Archaeol & Ethnog,Int Res Lab, Novosibirsk 2013, Russia; [Abdykanova, Aida] Amer Univ Cent Asia, Naryn, Kyrgyzstan; [Bittner, Peter] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zahir, Muhammad] Hazara Univ, Dept Archaeol, Mansehra, Pakistan; [Jarman, Nicholas] Natl Pk Serv, Valles Caldera Natl Preserve, Jemez Springs, NM 87025 USA; [Williams, Mark; Dixon, E.

The growth of the sector necessitates a re-evaluation of the environmental impacts of renewable energy on the continent to inform mitigation decisions. This study presents the first literature review of the life cycle assessments of renewable energy in Africa and gives an in-depth analysis of environmental issues that are specific to Africa's renewable energy sector. It performs a systematic assessment of literature on the topic, examines the state-of-the-art, and critically evaluates environmental impacts on the continent, implications of methodological choices, gaps, challenges, and compares the findings with other regions. Climate change has been extensively researched in the studies, due to decarbonisation being among policy priorities. Other relevant impact categories such as resource depletion in non-closed loop systems, ecotoxicity from recycling emissions, or ecosystem degradation from landfill leachate are not fully explored despite the end-of-life being potentially a major burden for the continent. Choice of functional units and multifunctional processes give wide variations in the magnitude of environmental impacts for similar technologies and, therefore, have implications for decision-making. For example, similar biodiesel jatropha systems with energy- and mass-based functional units differ by around 16% in their climate change potentials. To ensure that life cycle assessment results apply to mitigation decisions in Africa, studies should consider methodological issues such as lack of transparency in inventories, incomplete coverage of life cycle stages and impact categories, and missing databases adapted for the African context.

Then, centering teachers' voices, the authors use a dialogic narrative format to put two long-time friends and educators in conversation with one another and their teaching experiences, including the effects of standardized tests on students, classroom climates, teacher failure, and teacher morale. Specifically, they use their narratives to examine the degrees to which testing cultures have disrupted teaching literature. The reliance on text excerpts on tests fragments students' reading experiences, and discourage schools and English language arts teachers from engaging with complete literary works, such as novels and longer plays. The authors close with a call for more teachers' voices on the topic of testing, and a reflection on how teacher demoralization follows in part from continued national and state-level reliance on standardized tests.","[Shelton, Stephanie Anne] Univ Alabama, Coll Educ, Qualitat Res, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Shelton, Stephanie Anne] Dept Gender & Race Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Brooks, Tamara] Paul Duke STEM High Sch, Norcross, GA USA; [Brooks, Tamara] Georgia Governors Honors Program Commun Arts Dept, Norcross, GA USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Shelton, SA (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Coll Educ, Qualitat Res, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.;Shelton, SA (corresponding author), Dept Gender & Race Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",sashelton@ua.edu; tamara_brooks@gwinnett.k12.ga.us,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,0,"UNIV GEORGIA, COLL EDUCATION",ATHENS,"427 TUCKER HALL, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA",1559-9035,,,J LANG LIT EDUC,J.

This work introduces the notion of visceral citizenship and discusses how, through creative art forms, the identity and 'figure' of the Hong Kong protestor is (re)produced through its capacity to engender raw, affective feelings and orientations towards China through sensorial embodiments. In the aftermath of a recently introduced national security legislation creating a fresh climate of fear, cultural artefacts popular with pro-democracy Hong Kongers encourage the material consumption and (re)production of a localist identity and politics of belonging to Hong Kong that engenders visceral and affective responses from viewers. Visceral forms of belonging, it is argued, have the potential to not only create creative forms of activism but provide an important substrate to Hong Konger identities in the body.","[Lowe, John] Monash Univ, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Lowe, J (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",cartesiancircles@gmail.com,"Lowe, John/AAC-8573-2020","Lowe, John/0000-0001-5865-2480",,,,,63,4,4,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1030-4312,1469-3666,,CONTINUUM-J MEDIA CU,Continuum-J.

The chronostratigraphic framework of floral and vegetational events illustrates the development of cooler climates since the Pliocene. Floral and vegetational response to glacial/interglacial cycles, as well as major taxa replacements have been analysed with special attention to latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and to physiographic reorganizations. The pollen flora shows marked changes both at the beginning of the Pleistocene as well as at the time of the Mid-Pleistocene climate transition, when a major decrease in temperature, during both glacial and interglacial phases, occurred. Alternations of Artemisia steppe and thermophilous forest mark the overall glacial interglacial vegetation changes. However, in northern Italy, the latter are rather expressed by an alternating spread of altitudinal coniferous forest (mainly Picea), without significant expansion of steppe vegetation, and thermophilous forest. More complex vegetational cycles than those pointed out by earlier syntheses are also testified by the detection of an alpine vegetation spreading during glacial phases and a wooded steppe in the earlier phases of interglacials, in some southern marine sections. Such diversified patterns could be associated with obliquity related warm/humid-cold/dry interglacial-glacial cycles superimposed by precession related warm/dry-cold/humid cycles. However, the role of depositional processes as well as taphonomic biases should not be ignored in the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The priority of the effort so far has been to target specific scientific themes focusing on selected essential climate variables (ECVs), a range of known systematic biases common to ESMs, such as coupled tropical climate variability, monsoons, Southern Ocean processes, continental dry biases, and soil hydrology-climate interactions, as well as atmospheric CO2 budgets, tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, and tropospheric aerosols. The tool is being developed in such a way that additional analyses can easily be added. A set of standard namelists for each scientific topic reproduces specific sets of diagnostics or performance metrics that have demonstrated their importance in ESM evaluation in the peer-reviewed literature. The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community effort open to both users and developers encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) ensemble. This will facilitate and improve ESM evaluation beyond the state-of-the-art and aims at supporting such activities within CMIP and at individual modelling centres. Ultimately, we envisage running the ESMValTool alongside the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) as part of a more routine evaluation of CMIP model simulations while utilizing observations available in standard formats (obs4MIPs) or provided by the user.","[Eyring, Veronika;

Soil carbon change was calculated using the Rothamsted carbon model on a European 10 x 10' grid using climate data from four global climate models implementing four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions scenarios (SRES). Changes in net primary production (NPP) were calculated by the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model. Land-use change scenarios, interpreted from the narratives of the IPCC SRES story lines, were used to project changes in cropland and grassland areas. Projections for 1990-2080 are presented for mineral soil only. Climate effects (soil temperature and moisture) will tend to speed decomposition and cause soil carbon stocks to decrease, whereas increases in carbon input because of increasing NPP will slow the loss. Technological improvement may further increase carbon inputs to the soil. Changes in cropland and grassland areas will further affect the total soil carbon stock of European croplands and grasslands. While climate change will be a key driver of change in soil carbon over the 21st Century, changes in technology and land-use change are estimated to have very significant effects. When incorporating all factors, cropland and grassland soils show a small increase in soil carbon on a per area basis under future climate (1-7 t C ha(-1) for cropland and 3-6 t C ha(-1) for grassland), but when the greatly decreasing area of cropland and grassland are accounted for, total European cropland stocks decline in all scenarios, and grassland stocks decline in all but one scenario. Different trends are seen in different regions. For Europe (the EU25 plus Norway and Switzerland), the cropland SOC stock decreases from 11 Pg in 1990 by 4-6 Pg (39-54%) by 2080, and the grassland SOC stock increases from 6 Pg in 1990 to 1.5 Pg (25%) under the B1 scenario, but decreases to 1-3 Pg (20-44%) under the other scenarios. Uncertainty associated with the land-use and technology scenarios remains unquantified, but worst-case quantified uncertainties are 22.5% for croplands and 16% for grasslands, equivalent to potential errors of 2.5 and 1 Pg SOC, respectively. This is equivalent to 42-63% of the predicted SOC stock change for croplands and 33-100% of the predicted SOC stock change for grasslands. Implications for accounting for SOC changes under the Kyoto Protocol are discussed.","Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Geog, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Aberdeen; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Universite Catholique Louvain; Wageningen University & Research,"Smith, J (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Cruickshank Bldg,St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.",jo.smith@abdn.ac.uk,"Wattenbach, Martin/D-1482-2013; Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Smith, Jo U/F-7763-2012; Zaehle, Sönke/C-9528-2017; Montanarella, Luca/AAE-7112-2019; Rounsevell, Mark D A/AAC-4498-2021; Rounsevell, Mark D A/C-5481-2011","Wattenbach, Martin/0000-0002-1843-1031; Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Smith, Jo U/0000-0001-6984-6766; Zaehle, Sönke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Rounsevell, Mark D A/0000-0001-7476-9398; ",,,,,44,261,274,12,149,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

For this purpose, in situ ozone (O-3), meteorological parameters (atmospheric pressure and relative humidity), and black carbon (BC) are analyzed. The paper describes the synoptic-scale meteorological scenarios that are able to favor the development of ST over the southern Himalaya, by analyzing the meteorological fields provided by the ECMWF model (geopotential height, wind speed, and potential vorticity), satellite Ozone Monitoring Instrument data (total column ozone), and three-dimensional back trajectories calculated with the Lagrangian Analysis Tool (LAGRANTO) model. The study, which represents the first continuous classification of ST in the southern Himalaya, permitted classification of 94% of ST days within four synoptic-scale scenarios: stratospheric potential vorticity structures (PVS), subtropical jet stream (SJS), quasi-stationary ridges (QSR), and monsoon depressions (MD). SJS and PVS were the most frequent scenarios (48% and 30% of occurrences, respectively), QSR occurred for 12% of the ST days, and MD were detected only during the monsoon season (3%). SJS and PVS scenarios presented a peak frequency during the nonmonsoon seasons, when the jet stream and westerly disturbances influence atmospheric circulation over the southern Himalaya. During the identified ST, significant variations of O-3 (+24%) and BC (-56%) were recorded relative to the averaged 2-yr mean values. On average, PVS and SJS were the most effective synoptic-scale scenarios in modifying the O-3 and BC levels at NCO-P from postmonsoon to premonsoon seasons, and ST is one of the leading processes in defining the background BC variability at NCO-P.","[Bracci, A.; Cristofanelli, P.; Bonafe, U.; Calzolari, F.; Duchi, R.; Marinoni, A.; Roccato, F.; Bonasoni, P.] CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Bracci, A.; Sprenger, M.] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland; [Laj, P.] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Glaciol & Geophys Environm, Grenoble, France; [Vuillermoz, E.; Bonasoni, P.] EV K2 CNR Comm, Bergamo, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Cristofanelli, P (corresponding author), Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",p.cristofanelli@isac.cnr.it,"Bonasoni, Paolo/C-6338-2015; Bracci, Alessandro/AGZ-4030-2022; Marinoni, Angela/AAK-9587-2021; Cristofanelli, Paolo/AAA-5575-2021; Bracci, Alessandro/HGU-6017-2022","Bonasoni, Paolo/0000-0002-8812-5291; Bracci, Alessandro/0000-0001-7047-6213; Marinoni, Angela/0000-0002-6580-7126; Cristofanelli, Paolo/0000-0001-5666-9131; Sprenger, Michael/0000-0002-9317-8822; Calzolari, Francescopiero/0000-0003-4535-9626",,,,,70,13,13,1,33,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

In particular we analyse three simulations with differences in boundary nudging and horizontal resolution performed for the EU-project ENSEMBLES with the model version 2.4.6, and one with the latest version 4.0. Moreover, we include for comparison a long-term simulation with the RCM CHRM previously used at ETH Zurich. We provide a thorough validation of temperature, precipitation, net radiation, cloud cover, circulation, evaporation and terrestrial water storage for winter and summer. For temperature and precipitation the interannual variability is additionally assessed. While simulations with CLM version 2.4.6 are generally too warm and dry in summer but still within the typical error of PRUDENCE simulations, version 4.0 has an anomalous cold and wet bias. This is partly due to a strong underestimation of the net radiation associated with cloud cover overestimation. Two similar CLM 2.4.6 simulations with different spatial resolutions (0.44 degrees and 0.22 degrees) reveal for the analysed fields no clear benefit of the higher resolution except for better resolved fine-scale structures. While the large-scale circulation is represented more realistically with spectral nudging, temperature and precipitation are not.

In this work we describe the results of model runs for the time slices 6000 years BP (last climate optimum), 21 000 BP (last glacial maximum) and 115 000 years BP (glacial inception). Although the solar insolation is known for all time slices, a complete data set of the other boundary conditions which are necessary for running the atmospheric model exists only for the last glacial maximum in the form of the CLIMAP reconstruction. For the other two time slices, which are interglacial states like the modern climate, sea surface temperatures, land albedo and ice sheet topography are kept at modern values and only the solar insolation is changed appropriately. The response of the model to solar insolation changes is quite reasonable. The modelled anomalies are small and roughly opposite in sign for 6000 BP and 115 000 BP, respectively. In the case of last glacial maximum, the glacial ice sheet topography and ice albedo produce a much larger climate anomaly in the model. However, to enable a real test of model performance under glacial boundary conditions, the CLIMAP sea surface temperatures, which are now known to be partly inaccurate, should be replaced by an updated ''state-of-the-art'' reconstruction.","UNIV BREMEN, FACHBEREICH 5, GEOWISSENSCH, D-28334 BREMEN, GERMANY",University of Bremen,,,,"Helbig, Phillip/0000-0003-3637-0057",,,,,27,65,66,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0016-7835,,,GEOL RUNDSCH,Geol.

We review the state of the art in physical modelling, simulation and control of ventilated bulk storage facilities, and in particular the storage of potatoes, from a state-space perspective. The basic physical relations that describe the dynamic behaviour of air and potatoes in a storage facility use laws of conservation of mass, energy and momentum and corresponding constitutive laws. However, a very complex physically based storage model is obtained if the macro climate in the air channels and the micro climate around the potato and all the interactions between air and potato are taken into consideration. Therefore, lumped, 1-D, 2-D and 3-D macro, and also some micro climate storage models were developed. These models basically focus on heat and moisture generation and transportation. The latest developments give more and more insight into the spatial distribution of the macro climate, using CFD simulation techniques. Traditionally, the indoor climate instead of the potato quality is controlled, to maintain a good product quality. However, quality control of the product can be realised if there is knowledge between the spatial distribution of temperature and moisture and the product quality. With the developments in CFD simulation, control algorithms and the state space framework, modelling and control of product quality is within reach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This bias pattern occurred not only in the RCM results but also in the global climate model (GCM) results, so knowledge of the model uncertainties and their cascade is crucial for understanding and interpreting future climate. Our intention with this study was to examine whether a warm-and-dry bias is also present in the state-of-the-art EURO-CORDEX multi-model ensemble results in the summer season over the Pannonian Basin. Verification of EURO-CORDEX RCMs was carried out by using the E-OBS gridded dataset of daily mean, minimum, and maximum near-surface air temperature and total precipitation amount with a horizontal resolution of 0.1 degrees (approximately 12 km x 12 km) over the 1971-2000 time period. The model skill for selected period was expressed in terms of four verification scores: bias, centered root mean square error (RMSE), spatial correlation coefficient, and standard deviation. The main findings led us to conclude that most of the RCMs that overestimate temperature also underestimate precipitation. For some models, the positive temperature and negative precipitation bias were more emphasized, which led us to conclude that the problem was still present in most of the analyzed simulations.","[Lazic, Irida; Tosic, Milica; Djurdjevic, Vladimir] Univ Belgrade, Inst Meteorol, Fac Phys, Dobracina 16, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Lazic, I; Djurdjevic, V (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Inst Meteorol, Fac Phys, Dobracina 16, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",irida.lazic@ff.bg.ac.rs; milica.tosic@ff.bg.ac.rs; vdj@ff.bg.ac.rs,,"Djurdjevic, Vladimir/0000-0001-9882-1189; Tosic, Milica/0000-0002-4407-4090; Lazic, Irida/0000-0001-7355-2410","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [451-03-9/2021-14/200162]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, No. 451-03-9/2021-14/200162.",,55,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JUN,2021,6,,,,,,714,10.3390/atmos12060714,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12060714,,,23,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SX6MI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000665316200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The new TSI Radiometer Facility (TRF) is intended to provide such calibrations.

Implemented mitigation measures should ideally be cost-effective, but perfectly ranking alternative nutrient mitigation measures according to cost-effectiveness is a difficult methodological challenge. Furthermore, a particularly practical challenge is that cost-effective measures are not necessarily favoured by local stakeholders, and this may impede their successful implementation in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures using a methodology that includes a participatory process and social learning to ensure their successful implementation. By combining cost data, hydrological modelling and a bottom-up approach for three different European catchment areas (the Latvian Berze, the Swedish Helge and the German Selke rivers), the cost-effectiveness of 16 nutrient mitigation measures were analysed under current conditions as well as under selected scenarios for future climate and land-use changes. Fertiliser reduction, wetlands, contour ploughing and municipal wastewater treatment plants are the measures that remove nutrients with the highest cost-effectiveness in the respective case study context. However, the results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of measures not only depends on their design, specific location and the conditions of the surrounding area, but is also affected by the future changes the area may be exposed to. Climate and land-use changes do not only affect the cost-effectiveness of measures, but also shape the overall nutrient loads and potential target levels in a catchment.","[Carolus, Johannes Friedrich; Olsen, Soren Boye; Pedersen, Soren Marcus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Carolus, Johannes Friedrich; Schwarz, Gerald] Thuenen Inst Farm Econ, Bundesallee 63, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Bartosova, Alena] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Jomaa, Seifeddine; Rode, Michael] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal & Management, Bruckstr 3a, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany; [Veinbergs, Arturs] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, 19 Akad St, LV-3001 Jelgava, Latvia; [Zilans, Andis] Univ Latvia, Fac Geog & Earth Sci, Jelgavas Iela 1, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Tonderski, Karin] Linkoping Univ, IFM Biol, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden",University of Copenhagen; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; University of Latvia; Linkoping University,"Carolus, JF (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",johannes.carolus@thuenen.de,"Rode, Michael/ABA-4786-2021; Olsen, Søren/AAF-2208-2020; Rode, Michael/AAD-1014-2022; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/AAG-1351-2020; Jomaa, Seifeddine/P-7534-2017; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/O-6001-2015","Olsen, Søren/0000-0002-1278-3749; Rode, Michael/0000-0003-0086-2033; Jomaa, Seifeddine/0000-0003-4782-9468; Veinbergs, Arturs/0000-0001-5209-860X; Carolus, Johannes Friedrich/0000-0003-4617-0286; Schwarz, Gerald/0000-0001-9833-7362","BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme [185]; European Union; Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; Latvian Ministry of Education and Science; Polish National Centre for Research and Development; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS);  [4114-00005B]","BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme; European Union(European Commission); Innovation Fund Denmark; Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH; Latvian Ministry of Education and Science(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science); Polish National Centre for Research and Development; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); ","This work was partly carried out in the BONUS MIRACLE project (Call 2014-73) and has received funding from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea Research and Development Programme (Art 185), funded jointly by the European Union and the Innovation Fund Denmark (4114-00005B), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Latvian Ministry of Education and Science, Polish National Centre for Research and Development, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, and Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS).",,78,6,6,2,25,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

The recurrent spells of heat waves and droughts have severely affected the environmental conditions worldwide, including Pakistan. The present work sought to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in drought characteristics over Pakistan during Rabi and Kharif cropping seasons. The role of large-scale circulation and interannual mode of climate variability is further explored to identify the physical mechanisms associated with droughts in the region. Monthly precipitation and temperature data (1983-2019) from 53 meteorological stations were used to study drought characteristics, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The nonparametric Mann-Kendall, Sen's Slope, and Sequential Mann-Kendall tests were applied on the drought index to determine the statistical significance and magnitude of the historical trend. The state-of-the-art Bayesian Dynamic Linear model was further used to analyse large-scale climate drivers of droughts, revealed an increase in drought severity, mostly over arid to semiarid regions for both cropping seasons. While temperature played a significant role in defining droughts over dry and hot seasons, rainfall is influential over the western disturbances influenced region. The analysis of atmospheric circulation patterns revealed that large-scale changes in wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, and geopotential height anomalies are the likely drivers of droughts in the region. We found that Nino4, sea surface temperature, and multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO4.0) Index are the most influential factors for seasonal droughts across Pakistan. Overall, the findings provide a better understanding of drought-prone areas in the region, and this information is of potential use for mitigating and managing drought risks.","[Ullah, Irfan; Liu, Mengyang; Arshad, Muhammad] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Omer, Abubaker] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Saleem, Farhan] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Saleem, Farhan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Syed, Sidra] Univ Peshawar, Inst Peace & Conflicts Studies, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Habtemicheal, Birhanu Asmerom] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Sch Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Aerosol Cloud Precipitat,China Meteorol A, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Habtemicheal, Birhanu Asmerom] Wollo Univ, Dept Phys, Dessie, Ethiopia","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Peshawar; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",xyma@nuist.edu.cn,"Ullah, Irfan/AEN-0985-2022; Habtemicheal, Birhanu Asmerom Asmerom/AAX-2597-2021","Ullah, Irfan/0000-0002-6913-7481; Liu, Mengyang/0000-0002-5616-1538; Ma, Xieyao/0000-0002-3936-2020",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877158],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41877158",,74,21,21,9,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The IE technique uses multiple realization of atmospheric general circulation models coupled to a single ocean general circulation model. The ensembles mean fluxes from the atmospheric simulations are communicated to the ocean component. Each atmospheric simulation receives the same SST coming from the ocean component. The only difference among the atmospheric simulations comes from perturbed initial conditions, thus the atmospheric states are, in principle synoptically independent. The IE technique can be used to better understand the importance of weather noise forcing of natural variability such as El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To study the impact of weather noise and resolution in the context of a CGCM, two IE experiments are performed at different resolutions. Atmospheric resolution is an important issue since the noise statistics will depend on the spatial scales resolved. A simple formulation to extract atmospheric internal variability is presented. The results are compared to their respective control cases where internal atmospheric variability is left unchanged. The noise reduction has a major impact on the coupled simulation and the magnitude of this effect strongly depends on the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric component model. Specifically, applying the noise reduction technique reduces the overall climate variability more effectively at higher resolution. This suggests that weather noise is more important in sustaining climate variability as resolution increases. ENSO statistics, dynamics, and phase asymmetry are all modified by the noise reduction, in particular ENSO becomes more regular with less phase asymmetry when noise is reduced. All these effects are more marked for the higher resolution case. In contrast, ENSO frequency is unchanged by the reduction in the weather noise, but its phase-locking to the annual cycle is strongly dependent on noise and resolution. At low resolution the noise structure is similar to the signal, whereas the spatial structure of the noise deviates from the spatial structure of the signal as resolution increases. It is also suggested that event-to-event differences are largely driven by atmospheric noise as opposed to chaotic dynamics within the context of the large-scale coupled system, suggesting that there is a well-defined canonical event.","[Lopez, Hosmay; Kirtman, Ben P.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol & Phys Oceanog, Miami, FL 33149 USA",University of Miami,"Lopez, H (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol & Phys Oceanog, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",hlopez@rsmas.miami.edu,"Lopez, Hosmay/M-3278-2015","Lopez, Hosmay/0000-0002-8422-8699","NSF [ATM0754341, OCI10749165]; NOAA [NA08OAR4320889]; Directorate For Geosciences [1137911] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences [1137902] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This manuscript is part of a Ph.D dissertation of the first author.

The ASCE 77-88 ground snow loads were based on the data and methods available at the time and subsequently updated in 1995. The provided loads are based on 50-year mean recurrence intervals, with design loads for each category being obtained through a combination of partial safety and importance factors. Changes and improvements in snow load design over the last 40 year necessitate a reconsideration of the original calibration of these safety and importance factors. This paper discusses the need for a movement away from a uniform-hazard snow load design approach in combination with uniform load and importance factors, in favor of reliability-targeted design snow loads. This paper reviews the concept of reliability targeted loads as a means of meeting the ASCE 7 goal of uniform risk/reliability in the US. This paper further describes the incremental changes in both reliability and snow load research that will culminate in a change from uniform hazard (i.e. 50-year) loads to uniform-reliability loads. The purpose of this paper is to describe the motivation for, and historical context of E 7, the forthcoming changes to design ground snow loads in ASCE 7-22. Furthermore, the paper discusses the future of snow load prediction and its impact on the engineer and the code, particularly in regards to the implications of climate change for future snow load design.

The plot had been bought for the purpose of developing a luxury tourist area. The Partial Development Plan for Costa Teguise and the Hotel Las Salinas were the first steps in this ambitious project. The Las Salinas Hotel complex was designed with the whole of the island in mind. The study of the island's unique landscape provided the basis for understanding this new project. The island's geology, with its blanket of lava and the features it contained, was the starting point. The hotel was designed as a continuation of this layer, like a fold providing shelter for the lush vegetation. This protection from the inclemency of the weather favoured plant life. In a hostile climate with strong onshore winds, the project mirrored the care the local people had taken with their crops. This inward-looking space created a fertile microclimate. If, on the one hand, the outside of this dense fabric formed a seamless protuberance with the terrain on the island, on the other, the cracks or fractures fromed in this mass provided continuity down into the earth, as far as the cavities in which the centeral oasis grew, it could therefore be said that the interior and exterior of this isotropic magma were sometimes difficult to tell apart. The thickness of the terrain informed this uniformity. Water was a good reason for alluding to the mass's twin condition of superficial and deep. The hotel's outer skin, like a fabric that rose up and enveloped the mass, alluded to the nearby salt flats. It thus established an epidermal continuity with the surrounding terrain. Water, nonetheless, was drawn along by gravity as it found its way of pursuing its course. It the flowed into the depths through the cracks, on a journey interspersed with sundry pools, falls and other features. It thus conjured up and entire discourse that provided the rationale for the hotel's sequences of areas. This discourse of the water was established through a sequence of areas that ran from the outside, on the seashore, to then filmy inside the bulk of the building, It began in the swimming pool area to then infiltrate through the horizontal fracture on the facade into the inner cavities,. Heading in the opposite direction to an arriving guest, the water followed different courses until it reached the open-air courtyard that received guests once they had walked through the lobby. By heading upstream along these water courses, guests discovered the hotel's different areas. These two discourses, terrain and water, enabled Fernando Higueras and Cesar Manrique to work on a holistic work of art, each one within his sphere, but both in pursuit of an integral outcome, not in the sense of a Gesamtkunstwerk, as a display of different arts in a single performance, but instead as, the true integration of the arts in a single work.","[Arcaraz Puntonet, Jon] Univ Navarra, Dept Proyectos Urbanismo & Teoria & Hist, ETSA, Pamplona, Spain",University of Navarra,"Puntonet, JA (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Dept Proyectos Urbanismo & Teoria & Hist, ETSA, Pamplona, Spain.",jonarcaraz@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,FUNDACION ALEJANDRO DE LA SOTA,Madrid,"Calle de Breton de los Herreros, 66, Madrid, *, SPAIN",,,978-84-947421-5-6,,,,2017,,,,,48,65,,,,,,18,Architecture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Architecture,BQ7CN,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000614526900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Much of the continent is dependent on rain-fed agriculture, which makes it particularly susceptible to climate variability. Monitoring drought and providing timely seasonal forecasts are essential for integrated drought risk reduction. Current approaches in developing regions have generally been limited, however, in part because of unreliable monitoring networks. Operational seasonal climate forecasts are also deficient and often reliant on statistical regressions, which are unable to provide detailed information relevant for drought assessment. However, the wealth of data from satellites and recent advancements in large-scale hydrological modeling and seasonal climate model predictions have enabled the development of state-of-the-art monitoring and prediction systems that can help address many of the problems inherent to developing regions. An experimental drought monitoring and forecast system for sub-Saharan Africa is described that is based on advanced land surface modeling driven by satellite and atmospheric model data. Key elements of the system are the provision of near-real-time evaluations of the terrestrial water cycle and an assessment of drought conditions. The predictive element takes downscaled ensemble dynamical climate forecasts and provides, when merged with the hydrological modeling, ensemble hydrological forecasts. We evaluate the overall skill of the system for monitoring and predicting the development of drought and illustrate the use of the system for the 2010/11 Horn of Africa drought. A key element is the transition and testing of the technology for operational usage by African collaborators and we discuss this for two implementations in West and East Africa.","[Sheffield, Justin; Wood, Eric F.; Chaney, Nathaniel; Guan, Kaiyu; Sadri, Sara; Yuan, Xing] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ogallo, Laban] Intergovt Author Dev Climate Predict & Applicat C, Nairobi, Kenya; [Abou Amani] UNESCO Int Hydrol Programme, Nairobi, Kenya; [Ali, Abdou] Ctr Reg Format & Applicat Agrometeorol & Hydrol O, Niamey, Niger; [Demuth, Siegfried] UNESCO Int Hydrol Programme, Paris, France",Princeton University,"Sheffield, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",justin@princeton.edu,"Chaney, Nathaniel/L-9110-2015; Chaney, Nathaniel/AAR-2944-2020; Guan, Kaiyu/N-5772-2015; mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011","Chaney, Nathaniel/0000-0001-7120-1713; Chaney, Nathaniel/0000-0001-7120-1713; Guan, Kaiyu/0000-0002-3499-6382; Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630; Wood, Eric/0000-0001-7037-9675","UNESCO International Hydrology Program (IHP); NOAA Climate Program Office Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP) Program [NA11OAR4310097, NA10OAR4310130]","UNESCO International Hydrology Program (IHP); NOAA Climate Program Office Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP) Program","The authors acknowledge the support of the UNESCO International Hydrology Program (IHP) for supporting the initial development of the system, training workshops, and exchange visits.

In mainland Portugal the most common ground temperature varies from 20 to 40 degrees C, depending on the place where the geothermal boreholes are placed, which means that low enthalpy systems can be considered. Currently the increased development of ground source heat pumps (GSHP) lead to a continuous development and innovation of ground heat exchangers (GHE). The geothermal systems can contribute with savings between 25-75% of the energy demands of buildings' HVAC systems, making it a very appealing solution mainly in northern and central Europe. The goal of this paper is to analyse the performance of a geothermal system installed in a department of the University of Aveiro, in the center of Portugal. Firstly, an introduction about different GHE systems is done and after a real case study is described and the methodology applied. To achieve the goal established, the building was analysed, audit and modeled, and an energy simulation was carried out with EnergyPlus (R) 8.6 (EP) software. After the results obtained it can be concluded that even in regions with mild climate as Aveiro, the geothermal system contributes with 34% of savings of the annual global primary energy needs.

The higher regions are comprised of flood basalts and are immediately underlain by predominantly aeolian-origin sandstones. Our understanding of the weathering of these basalts and sandstones is reviewed here, with particular focus on the insights gained from the Lesotho Highlands Water Project and an ongoing study into the deterioration of rock art. While the chemical weathering attributes of the basalts have been substantially investigated, it is evident that the environmental surface conditions of rock moisture and temperature, as affecting weathering processes, remain largely unknown. Within the sandstones, studies pertaining to rock art deterioration present insights into the potential surface weathering processes and highlight the need for detailed field monitoring. Outside of these site-specific studies, however, little is understood of how weathering impacts on landscape development; notably absent, are detail on weathering rates, and potential effects of biological weathering. Some palaeoenvironmental inferences have also been made from weathering products, both within the basalts and the sandstones, but aspects of these remain controversial and further detailed research can still be undertaken.

Although well-known ecological patterns apply to most ponds in Europe and elsewhere, recent data highlight that part of the environmental variables governing pond biodiversity remain specific to climatic/biogeographic regions and to elevation ranges, suggesting that, in addition to common practice, management plans should include range-specific measures. Beyond the contribution of individual ponds to the aquatic and terrestrial life, connected networks of ponds are vital in the provision of new climate space as a response to global climate change, by allowing the observed northward and/or upward movements of species. In terms of services, ponds offer sustainable solutions to key issues of water management and climate change such as nutrient retention, rainfall interception, or carbon sequestration. While the ecological role of ponds is now well-established, authoritative research-based advice remains needed to inform future direction in the conservation of small water bodies and to further bridge the gap between science and practice.","[Cereghino, Regis] Univ Toulouse, INP, UPS EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Cereghino, Regis] CNRS, EcoLab, UMR 5245, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Boix, Dani] Univ Girona UdG, Inst Ecol Aquat, Girona 17071, Catalonia, Spain; [Cauchie, Henry-Michel] Ctr Rech Publ Gabriel Lippman, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Martens, Koen] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Oertli, Beat] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, CH-1254 Jussey, Switzerland",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Universitat de Girona; Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland,"Cereghino, R (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INP, UPS EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, F-31062 Toulouse, France.",regis.cereghino@univ-tlse3.fr,"Oertli, Beat/GXV-4967-2022; Cauchie, Henry-Michel FV/K-8123-2014; Boix, Dani/L-5190-2014","Cauchie, Henry-Michel FV/0000-0003-4780-6100; Boix, Dani/0000-0001-5468-2236; Cereghino, Regis/0000-0003-3981-3159; Oertli, Beat/0000-0002-8372-9045",Fonds National de la Recherche (Luxembourg) [FNR/12/AM3/15]; Centre de Recherche Public - Gabriel Lippmann,Fonds National de la Recherche (Luxembourg)(Luxembourg National Research Fund); Centre de Recherche Public - Gabriel Lippmann,"The fifth conference of the European Pond Conservation Network has been made possible thanks to funding by the Fonds National de la Recherche (Luxembourg) (Convention FNR/12/AM3/15) and the Centre de Recherche Public - Gabriel Lippmann.

A few decades ago, hydropower reservoirs were found to be a clean source of renewable energy, but after the pre-industrial era (1990s), these reservoirs were emitting a significant amount of greenhouse gases (GHG). The GHG are contributing a huge share to the regional/global carbon budget. The current study represents the first regional review and focuses on: present scenarios of Indian hydropower, environmental issues, constraints in dam construction, identified key predictors (i.e., age, depth of reservoir) impacting GHG potential, GHG risk to reservoirs, and suggested mitigation measures to the way forward for the sustainable planning of hydropower development. The review reveals that most Indian hydropower reservoirs are coming under the low to medium GHG risk of reservoirs. Small hydropower projects (SHPs) are deliberated as a worthy alternative for the sustainable management of hydropower projects. There are still many issues associated with SHPs, which cannot be neglected completely.

This package implements the adjoint and Hessian codes, generated using automatic differentiation techniques, of a cost function balancing ( 1) the deviation from the a priori knowledge on the model parameter values and ( 2) the misfit between the observed remote-sensing fluxes and the two-stream model simulations. The individual weights of these contributions are specified notably via covariance matrices of the uncertainties in the a priori knowledge on the model parameters and the measurements. The proposed procedure delivers a Gaussian approximation of the PDFs of the retrieved model parameter values. The a posteriori covariance matrix is further exploited to evaluate, in turn, the posterior probability density functions of the radiant fluxes simulated by the two-stream model, including those that are not measured, for example, the fraction of radiation absorbed in the ground. Applications are conducted using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) broadband surface albedo products. It turns out that the differences between these two albedo sets may translate into discernible signatures on some retrieved model parameters. Meanwhile, adding the Joint Research Centre (JRC)-Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) products into the measurements yields a significant reduction of uncertainties. Results from these applications indicate that the products retrieved from the two-stream inversion procedure ( 1) exhibit much less variability than those generated by the operational algorithms for the LAI and FAPAR, and ( 2) are in good agreement with the available ground-based estimates.","European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Global Environm Monitoring Unit, I-21020 Ispra, VA, Italy; FastOpt, D-20357 Hamburg, Germany",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Pinty, B (corresponding author), European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Global Environm Monitoring Unit, TP 440,Via E Fermi, I-21020 Ispra, VA, Italy.",bernard.pinty@jrc.it,"Verstraete, Michel/Q-4430-2017","Verstraete, Michel/0000-0003-0968-8721; Lavergne, Thomas/0000-0002-9498-4551",,,,,47,52,53,3,22,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

This includes improved collaborations within the scientific community but also enhanced dialogue between scientists and societal stakeholders, especially with Arctic communities. As a contribution to the Third International Conference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARPIII), the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) network held an international workshop in France, in October 2014, in order to discuss high-priority requirements for future Arctic marine and coastal research from an early-career scientists (ECS) perspective. The discussion encompassed a variety of research fields, including topics of oceanographic conditions, sea-ice monitoring, marine biodiversity, land-ocean interactions, and geological reconstructions, as well as law and governance issues. Participants of the workshop strongly agreed on the need to enhance interdisciplinarity in order to collect comprehensive knowledge about the modern and past Arctic Ocean's geo-ecological dynamics. Such knowledge enables improved predictions of Arctic developments and provides the basis for elaborate decision-making on future actions under plausible environmental and climate scenarios in the high northern latitudes. Priority research sheets resulting from the workshop's discussions were distributed during the ICARPIII meetings in April 2015 in Japan, and are publicly available online.

In the systematic review, 144 papers were categorised and analysed according to their concept terminology, topic, location, used methodology, publication type, year, citations and keywords. The results document the growing but thematically and geographically unbalanced attention given to CFNs. Most research (31.9 %) was connected to the energy system, whereas social aspects (4.2 %) and the microclimate (3.5 %) were least researched. Within the analysed literature, 35 different terminologies for CFNs were used which highlights the lack of clear definitions and arbitrary use of terminologies. This issue is also reflected in the significant differences of CFN definitions from public initiatives and research projects. This article stresses the need for clear, comprehensible and structured definitions, including KPIs, system boundaries, as well as definitions of the spatial scales.","[Brozovsky, Johannes; Gustavsen, Arild; Gaitani, Niki] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Design, NTNU, Dept Architecture & Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Brozovsky, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Design, NTNU, Dept Architecture & Technol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",johannes.brozovsky@ntnu.no; arild.gustavsen@ntnu.no; niki.gaitani@ntnu.no,,"Brozovsky, Johannes/0000-0001-5485-1431",Research Council of Norway; ZEN partners,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); ZEN partners,This paper has been written within the Research Centre on Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in Smart Cities (FME ZEN).

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) proved to be a solid and flexible platform for design development and validation to meet such challenges within tight schedules, and deliver state-of-the art designs for high performance buildings. This paper will present the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations at Dar Al-Handasah to develop an innovative air-conditioning system for high-ceilinged paces in hot and dry climates based on radiant cooling coupled with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS). Specifically, the performance effectiveness of the proposed cooling strategy in establishing a comfortable thermal environment is compared against a conventional overhead supply ceiling diffusers system by conducting a detailed investigation of airflow delivery and temperature distribution in a typical transient high-ceilinged assembly hall during full load and part load conditions. Moreover, to analyze accurately the performance of the compared VAC designs, several parameters have been considered such as the supply airflow rate and temperature, the air distribution layout, radiant floor temperature and heat loads. The findings indicate that the proposed cooling strategy based on a combination of radiant cooling with DOAS helped achieve a thermally uniform environment with markedly improved thermal comfort conditions and reduced energy use as compared to the conventional design and the study concludes with a set of recommendations to optimize the air conditioning system energy use and thermal comfort levels in such spaces.","[Ghoussoub, Youssef; Akhdar, Adnan] Dar Al Handasah, Mech Dept, CFD Unit, Beirut, Lebanon",,"Ghoussoub, Y (corresponding author), Dar Al Handasah, Mech Dept, CFD Unit, Beirut, Lebanon.",,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",2572-5688,,,INT C BUILD DES-MAT,,,2018,,,,,178,187,,,,,,10,Construction & Building Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology,BM1LH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000460215500021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, in 2015, to better monitor the level of adaptation to flooding of Quebec residents living in or near a flood-prone area, the Quebec Observatory of Adaptation to Climate Change developed five indices of adaptation to flooding, according to the chronology of events. The present study was conducted 4 years later and is a follow-up to the 2015 one. Two independent samples of 1951 (2015) and 974 (2019) individuals completed a questionnaire on their adoption (or non-adoption) of flood adaptation behaviors, their perception of the mental and physical impacts of flooding, and their knowledge of the fact that they lived in a flood-prone area.The results of the study demonstrated the measurement invariance of the five indices across two different samples of people over time, ensuring that the differences (or absence of differences) observed in flood-related adaptive behaviors between 2015 and 2019 were real and not due to measurement errors. They also showed that, overall, Quebeckers' flood-related adaptive behaviors have not changed considerably since 2015, with adaptation scores being similar in 2019 for four of the five flood indices. Moreover, the results indicated an increase in self-reported physical and mental health issues related to past flooding events, as well as a larger proportion of people having consulted a health professional because of these problems. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of flood adaptation in Quebec over the past 4 years and confirms that the five adaptive behavior indices developed in 2015 are appropriate tools for monitoring changes in flood adaptation in the province. Finally, our results showed that little has changed in Quebeckers' adoption of adaptive behaviors, highlighting the need for awareness raising in order to limit the impacts that climate change will have on the population.","[Valois, Pierre; Tessier, Maxime; Bouchard, David] Univ Laval, Fac Educ, 2320 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Talbot, Denis] Univ Laval, Fac Med, 1050 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Morin, Alexandre J.

Many governments and the decision makers have recognized the requirement of resilient flood management policies and strategies for sustainable urban development. During the recent decades, various conceptual framework of flood risk assessment and management emerged and they in turn questioned the characterization of resilience in flood risk management. More recently, research on flood risk management and spatial planning have demonstrated a common discussion platform appreciating the concept of flood resilience in policy and strategy making. However, assessment and operationalization of flood resilience is often questionable due to its conceptual vagueness. The present work is a review of the plurality views of flood resilience. Resilience thinking has moved the focus of flood risk assessment towards vulnerability. Flood resilience embeds the incorporation of spatially distributed land use policies and regulations which are a must for the management of flood vulnerability. Spatial planning reflecting flood resilience becomes vital when managing the uncertainty incorporated with flood risk management. However, the operationalization and legitimacy of the importance of the combined role of spatial planning and flood risk management with stakeholder acceptance still remains implicit and weak.","[Herath, H.

A mixed-methods study measured the program impacts on students. Results from summer implementations in 2018 and 2019 suggest that participation in LECC increased students' awareness, confidence, and engagement around climate topics and their interest in contributing to community resilience efforts.

A Boundary Layer Scintillometer was installed along a 1.7 km path crossing a bay of the Baltic Sea (Eckernfoerder Bucht) at a height of 4.7 m above water level. Meteorological parameters were measured simultaneously. One of the main parameters, which effects C-n(2), is the temperature difference between air and ground. In general a larger temperature difference causes stronger turbulence. Over sea, the air-sea temperature difference, ASTD, is generally smaller than the air-ground temperature difference over land, which implicates smaller C-n(2) values. Turbulence over sea differs significantly from turbulence over land. The diurnal run of C-n(2) does not show generally the characteristic maximum at midday, C-n(2) values measured during night are not generally smaller than those measured at midday, and C-n(2) values measured in the daytime in summer are not generally larger than those measured in winter season. Since C-n(2) usually changes with environmental conditions, its influence on the effectiveness of electro-optical systems can normally only be expressed in a statistical way. We worked out a statistical database for atmospheric turbulence over sea accordingly to our turbulence statistics over land. The cumulative frequency of occurrence was calculated for a period of one month for a two-hour time interval during daytime and during night. Even though the meteorological conditions in Central Europe show a large variability, the cumulative frequencies of occurrence derived for 2003 and 2004 indicate the same seasonal devolution. We applied the LWKD model of the Defence Research and Development, DRDC Valcartier, Canada, to calculate C-n(2) as a function of ASTD for the measured meteorological parameters. The measurements indicate larger C-n(2) values than the calculations.","FGAN FOM, D-76275 Ettlingen, Germany",,"Weiss-Wrana, KR (corresponding author), FGAN FOM, Gutleuthausstr 1, D-76275 Ettlingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,9,10,10,0,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-6459-7,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2006,,,,,F3640,F3640,63640F,10.1117/12.693496,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.693496,,,12,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Optics,BFI66,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000242041100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dynamical assessments are based on the HadAM2b atmospheric model forced with the Met Office Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature Dataset (GISST3). Ensembles of simulations and hindcasts starting from real initial conditions for 1982-93 made under the European Community Prediction of Climate Variations on Seasonal to Interannual Timescales (PROVOST) program are analyzed. The results demonstrate a relatively high degree of predictability. Its source lies mostly in tropical Atlantic and Pacific sea surface temperatures. The results confirm the less extensive evidence of other authors that northeast Brazil is a region where two separate ocean basins influence seasonal climate to a comparable extent. Overall, the sea surface temperature gradient between the northern and southern tropical Atlantic appears to be the more important influence, though El Nino can be dominant when it is strong. These assessments of predictability are consistent with the performance of over a decade of real-time long lead and updated forecasts, issued over the period 1987-98. Multiple regression and linear discriminant analysis prediction techniques, together with model forecasts in the last few years, were used to provide best estimate and probability real-time forecasts of rainy season rainfall. These forecasts had a level of skill that was close to the state of the art in seasonal forecasting.","Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Colman, AW (corresponding author), Hadley Ctr Climate Predict & Res, Met Off, London Rd, Bracknell RG12 2SY, Berks, England.",,"Folland, Chris K/I-2524-2013; Rowell, David P/AAF-3674-2019","Folland, Chris K/0000-0002-3143-5918; Rowell, David P/0000-0002-6727-1732",,,,,56,120,127,0,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Potential applications include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance and wide-ranging applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information that links the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable environmental development, and food security.","[Babaeian, Ebrahim; Tuller, Markus] Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Sadeghi, Morteza; Jones, Scott B.] Utah State Univ, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Montzka, Carsten; Vereecken, Harry] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci Agrosphere IBG 3, Julich, Germany",University of Arizona; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Tuller, M (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Soil Water & Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",mtuller@email.arizona.edu,"Tuller, Markus/H-1822-2012","Tuller, Markus/0000-0003-3659-2768; Montzka, Carsten/0000-0003-0812-8570; Vereecken, Harry/0000-0002-8051-8517","National Science Foundation (NSF) [1521164, 1521469]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea),We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) via grants 1521164 and 1521469 awarded to the University of Arizona and Utah State University.

Time series of monthly temperature and precipitation were evaluated because of their importance for climate studies. The algorithms were validated against a realistic benchmark dataset. Participants provided 25 separate homogenized contributions as part of the blind study as well as 22 additional solutions submitted after the details of the imposed inhomogeneities were revealed. These homogenized datasets were assessed by a number of performance metrics including i) the centered root mean square error relative to the true homogeneous values at various averaging scales, ii) the error in linear trend estimates and iii) traditional contingency skill scores. The metrics were computed both using the individual station series as well as the network average regional series. The performance of the contributions depends significantly on the error metric considered. Although relative homogenization algorithms typically improve the homogeneity of temperature data, only the best ones improve precipitation data. Moreover, state-of-the-art relative homogenization algorithms developed to work with an inhomogeneous reference are shown to perform best. The study showed that currently automatic algorithms can perform as well as manual ones.","[Venema, V. K.

Prior hydrological intensification work has largely focused on precipitation without joint consideration of evaporative demand changes and how plants respond to these changes. Informed by state-of-the-art climate models, we examine projected changes in hydrological intensification and its role in complicating water resources management using a framework that accounts for precipitation surplus and evaporative demand. Using a metric that combines the difference between daily precipitation and daily evaporative demand (surplus events) and consecutive days when evaporative demand exceeds precipitation (deficit time), we show that, globally, surplus events will become larger (+11.5% and +18.5% for moderate and high emission scenarios, respectively) and the duration between them longer (+5.1%; +9.6%) by the end of the century, with the largest changes in the northern latitudes. The intra-annual occurrence of these extremes will stress existing water management infrastructure in major river basins, where over one third of years during 2070-2100 under a moderate emissions scenario will be hydrologically intense (large intra-annual increases in surplus intensity and deficit time), tripling that of the historical baseline. Larger increases in hydrologically intense years are found in basins with large reservoir capacity (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Danube River Basins), which have significant populations, irrigate considerable farmland, and support threatened and endangered aquatic species. Incorporating flexibility into water resource infrastructure and management will be paramount with continued hydrological intensification.","[Ficklin, Darren L.; Myers, Daniel T.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Null, Sarah E.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT USA; [Abatzoglou, John T.] Univ Calif Merced, Management Complex Syst, Merced, CA USA; [Novick, Kimberly A.] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of California System; University of California Merced; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ficklin, DL (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dficklin@indiana.edu,"Abatzoglou, John T/C-7635-2012; Null, Sarah/E-4422-2011; Myers, Daniel/O-6516-2018","Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Null, Sarah/0000-0001-7451-7908; Myers, Daniel/0000-0002-1932-5775","Lilly Endowment, Inc.; National Science Foundation [CNS-0521433]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2021-69012-35916]; National Sciences Foundation [1653452]","Lilly Endowment, Inc.; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Sciences Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by Lilly Endowment, Inc., through its support for the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute.

The success of the LTDH has fuelled a lot of research interest in district energy systems, one of the new research topics has been focusing on reducing the operating temperatures down to the ambient temperature (ATDH), commonly referred as 5th generation district heating. In these systems the supply temperature is insufficient for fulfilling the heating demands of the connected buildings, which then requires end-user located heat pumps to raise the supply temperature to the level required by the buildings. As of today, number of ATDH systems have been realized as part of various research projects. The question however remains if ATDH brings additional benefits compared to LTDH.

But given the limited range of operational energy impacts that can be directly influenced by building regulations, and the wide variation in energy use behaviours of building users, what system performance levels will be required to ensure new homes achieve that standard? This paper utilises in-home energy monitoring from a near net zero energy estate to provide the evidence of the system performance needed for all major end-uses, for homes in warm temperate climates to achieve, on average, a net zero operational energy standard. The evidence presented in this paper points to the combination of passive solar design strategies, energy efficient appliances, and active solar systems that will lead to net zero energy performance given contemporary lifestyles and the impact of the digital age.

Tree-ring series of European oaks (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) have provided a reliable framework for chronometric dating and reconstruction of past climate and environment. To date, long oak chronologies cover almost the entire Holocene, up to 8480 BC and the network over the entire area in which the two oaks grow is being improved. We present the main characteristics of oak ring series and discuss the latest methodological advances in defining the calendar year in which the tree-rings were formed and in interpreting such dating in terms of the age of a wooden object. Dendrochronology has established itself as a standard dating tool and has been applied in a wide variety of (pre-)historical studies. Archaeological wood, historical buildings, works of art (such as panel paintings and sculptures) have been successfully investigated. Recent advances in dendro-provenancing have helped to obtain more information on the timber trade in the past. Information on past forest structures, silviculture and timber use have become available through scrutinizing historical and contemporary ring-width patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we used an integrated dataset from four forests in the Brasil flux network, spanning a range of dry-season intensities and lengths, to determine how well four state-of-the-art models (IBIS, ED2, JULES, and CLM3.5) simulated the seasonality of carbon exchanges in Amazonian tropical forests. We found that most DGVMs poorly represented the annual cycle of gross primary productivity (GPP), of photosynthetic capacity (Pc), and of other fluxes and pools. Models simulated consistent dry-season declines in GPP in the equatorial Amazon (Manaus K34, Santarem K67, and Caxiuana CAX); a contrast to observed GPP increases. Model simulated dry-season GPP reductions were driven by an external environmental factor, 'soil water stress' and consequently by a constant or decreasing photosynthetic infrastructure (Pc), while observed dry-season GPP resulted from a combination of internal biological (leaf-flush and abscission and increased Pc) and environmental (incoming radiation) causes. Moreover, we found models generally overestimated observed seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and respiration (Re) at equatorial locations. In contrast, a southern Amazon forest (Jaru RJA) exhibited dry-season declines in GPP and Re consistent with most DGVMs simulations. While water limitation was represented in models and the primary driver of seasonal photosynthesis in southern Amazonia, changes in internal biophysical processes, light-harvesting adaptations (e.g., variations in leaf area index (LAI) and increasing leaf-level assimilation rate related to leaf demography), and allocation lags between leaf and wood, dominated equatorial Amazon carbon flux dynamics and were deficient or absent from current model formulations. Correctly simulating flux seasonality at tropical forests requires a greater understanding and the incorporation of internal biophysical mechanisms in future model developments.","[Restrepo-Coupe, Natalia] Univ Technol Sydney, Plant Funct Biol & Climate Change Cluster, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Restrepo-Coupe, Natalia; Christoffersen, Bradley O.; Albert, Loren P.; Wu, Jin; Saleska, Scott R.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Levine, Naomi M.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Levine, Naomi M.; Moorcroft, Paul] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Christoffersen, Bradley O.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Christoffersen, Bradley O.; Zeng, Xubin] Univ Arizona, Dept Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Wu, Jin] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Biol Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Costa, Marcos H.; Imbuzeiro, Hewlley] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Galbraith, David] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Martins, Giordane; da Araujo, Alessandro C.] INPA, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [da Araujo, Alessandro C.] Embrapa Amazonia Oriental, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Malhi, Yadvinder S.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England",University of Technology Sydney; University of Arizona; University of Southern California; Harvard University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; University of Arizona; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Universidade Federal de Vicosa; University of Leeds; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); University of Oxford,"Restrepo-Coupe, N (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Plant Funct Biol & Climate Change Cluster, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Restrepo-Coupe, N (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",nataliacoupe@gmail.com,"Costa, Marcos H/A-5695-2009; Saleska, Scott R/K-1733-2016; Wu, Jin/P-7389-2019; Wu, Jin/H-2582-2017; Albert, Loren/ABI-3168-2020; Galbraith, David/AAE-8162-2019; Restrepo-Coupe, Natalia/C-3507-2015","Costa, Marcos H/0000-0001-6874-9315; Saleska, Scott R/0000-0002-4974-3628; Wu, Jin/0000-0001-8991-3970; Wu, Jin/0000-0001-8991-3970; Albert, Loren/0000-0002-9674-6071; Restrepo-Coupe, Natalia/0000-0003-3921-1772; Galbraith, David/0000-0002-5555-4823; Zeng, Xubin/0000-0001-7352-2764; Levine, Naomi/0000-0002-4963-0535","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; NASA LBA-DMIP project [NNX09AL52G]; Plant Functional Biology and Climate Change Cluster at the University of Technology Sydney; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LBA investigation [CD-32]; National Science Foundation's Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) [OISE-0730305]; US DOE (BER) NGEE-Tropics project; Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE-Tropics) project from the US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DESC00112704]; NERC [NE/J023418/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J023418/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); NASA LBA-DMIP project; Plant Functional Biology and Climate Change Cluster at the University of Technology Sydney; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LBA investigation; National Science Foundation's Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); US DOE (BER) NGEE-Tropics project(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE-Tropics) project from the US DOE, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation 'Simulations from the Interactions between Climate, Forests, and Land Use in the Amazon Basin: Modeling and Mitigating Large Scale Savannization' project and the NASA LBA-DMIP project (# NNX09AL52G).

Climate change has frequently been postulated as a primary driver of the appearance of these innovative behaviours, with researchers invoking either climate instability as a reason for the development of buffering mechanisms, or environmentally stable refugia as providing a stable setting for experimentation. Testing these alternative models has proved intractable, however, as existing regional palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records remain spatially, stratigraphically, and chronologically disconnected from the archaeological record. Here we report high-resolution records of environmental shifts based on stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in ostrich eggshell (OES) fragments, faunal remains, and shellfish assemblages excavated from two key MSA archaeological sequences, Blombos Cave and Klipdrift Shelter. We compare these records with archaeological material remains in the same strata. The results from both sites, spanning the periods 98-73 ka and 72-59 ka, respectively, show significant changes in vegetation, aridity, rainfall seasonality, and sea temperature in the vicinity of the sites during periods of human occupation. While these changes clearly influenced human subsistence strategies, we find that the remarkable cultural and technological innovations seen in the sites cannot be linked directly to climate shifts. Our results demonstrate the need for scale-appropriate, on-site testing of behavioural-environmental links, rather than broader, regional comparisons.","[Roberts, Patrick; Lee-Thorp, Julia] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford, England; [Henshilwood, Christopher S.; van Niekerk, Karen L.; Keene, Petro; Reynard, Jerome] Univ Witwatersrand, Evolutionary Studies Inst, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Henshilwood, Christopher S.; van Niekerk, Karen L.] Univ Bergen, Dept Archaeol Hist Cultural Studies & Relig, Bergen, Norway; [Gledhill, Andrew] Univ Bradford, Div Geog Archaeol & Environm Sci, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Reynard, Jerome] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Badenhorst, Shaw] Ditsong Natl Museum Nat Hist, Archaeozool & Large Mammal Sect, Paul Kruger St, Pretoria, South Africa; [Badenhorst, Shaw] Univ South Africa, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Durban, South Africa",University of Oxford; University of Witwatersrand; University of Bergen; University of Bradford; University of Witwatersrand; University of South Africa,"Roberts, P (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford, England.",patrick.roberts@rlaha.ox.ac.uk,"Reynard, Jerome/AGV-6706-2022; Badenhorst, Shaw/HGC-7123-2022; Henshilwood, Christopher S/K-3806-2014; van Niekerk, Karen/J-3511-2015","Reynard, Jerome/0000-0002-7092-2188; Badenhorst, Shaw/0000-0002-6651-9660; Henshilwood, Christopher S/0000-0002-2818-293X; van Niekerk, Karen/0000-0003-2261-6861; Roberts, Patrick/0000-0002-4403-7548","Clarendon Fund; Natural Environmental Research Council; National Research Foundation/Department of Science and Technology at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa; University of Bergen, Norway; University of Oxford; NERC [NE/G005338/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G005338/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Clarendon Fund; Natural Environmental Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); National Research Foundation/Department of Science and Technology at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa; University of Bergen, Norway; University of Oxford; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This research would not have been possible without financial support from the Clarendon Fund, University of Oxford, and a Natural Environmental Research Council studentship to PR.

Recently, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) have been introduced to describe alternative social, economic and technical narratives, spanning a wide range of plausible futures in terms of challenges to mitigation and adaptation1. Thus far the key drivers of the uncertainty in emissions projections have not been robustly disentangled. Here we assess the sensitivities of future CO2 emissions to key drivers characterizing the SSPs. We use six state-of-the-art integrated assessment models with different structural characteristics, and study the impact of five families of parameters, related to population, income, energy effciency, fossil fuel availability, andlow-carbon energy technology development. A recently developed sensitivity analysis algorithm2 allows us to parsimoniously compute both the direct and interaction effects of each of these drivers on cumulative emissions. The study reveals that the SSP assumptions about energy intensity and economic growth are the most important determinants of future CO2 emissions from energy combustion, both with and without a climate policy. Interaction terms between parameters are shown to be important determinants of the total sensitivities.","[Marangoni, G.; Tavoni, M.; Bosetti, V.] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, G.; Tavoni, M.; Bosetti, V.] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Marangoni, G.; Tavoni, M.] Politecn Milan, Dept Management & Econ, Via Lambruschini 4-B, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Bosetti, V.; Borgonovo, E.] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Capros, P.; Karkatsoulis, P.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Zografou Campus, GR-15773 Athens, Greece; [Fricko, O.; Havlik, P.; Huppmann, D.; Johnson, N.; Krey, V.] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Gernaat, D.

In this study, the authors focus on the seasonally integrated power dissipation index (PDI) as a metric to project changes in tropical cyclone intensity. Based on a recently developed statistical model, this study examines projections in North Atlantic PDI using output from 17 state-of-the-art global climate models and three radiative forcing scenarios. Overall, the authors find that North Atlantic PDI is projected to increase with respect to the 1986-2005 period across all scenarios. The difference between the PDI projections and those of the number of North Atlantic tropical cyclones, which are not projected to increase significantly, indicates an intensification of North Atlantic tropical cyclones in response to both greenhouse gas (GHG) increases and aerosol changes over the current century. At the end of the twenty-first century, the magnitude of these increases shows a positive dependence on projected GHG forcing. The projected intensification is significantly enhanced by non-GHG (primarily aerosol) forcing in the first half of the twenty-first century.","[Villarini, Gabriele] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Vecchi, Gabriel A.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA",University of Iowa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Villarini, G (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",gabriele-villarini@uiowa.edu,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; Villarini, Gabriele/F-8069-2016","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Villarini, Gabriele/0000-0001-9566-2370","Iowa Flood Center, IIHR-Hydroscience and Engineering; U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison","Iowa Flood Center, IIHR-Hydroscience and Engineering; U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","Gabriele Villarini acknowledges financial support by the Iowa Flood Center, IIHR-Hydroscience and Engineering.

These include a reduction in the amount of precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project future water supply reliability, it is crucial to obtain a better understanding of the underlying cause or causes for these changes. A regional warming is often posited as the cause of these changes without formal testing of different competitive explanations for the warming. In this study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis is performed to determine the causes of the late winter/early spring changes in hydrologically relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges of the western United States. Natural internal climate variability, as estimated from two long control climate model simulations, is insufficient to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C (a simple proxy for temperature-driven snowmelt). These observed changes are also inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic activity. The observations are consistent with climate simulations that include the combined effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is identifiable in observational fields. The results are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the choice of statistical down-scaling method, and to various processing options in the detection and attribution method.","[Bonfils, Celine] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Pierce, David W.; Hidalgo, Hugo G.; Das, Tapash; Barnett, Tim P.; Cayan, Daniel R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cayan, Daniel R.] US Geol Survey, La Jolla, CA USA; [Wood, Andrew W.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nozawa, Toru] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Bonfils, C (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag, POB 808,Mail Stop L-103, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",bonfils2@llnl.gov,"Santer, Ben/ABA-1099-2021; Bala, Govindasamy/ABF-3255-2020; Hidalgo, Hugo G./I-7170-2019; Santer, Benjamin D/F-9781-2011; Wood, Andrew/L-5133-2013; Bonfils, Celine/H-2356-2012","Bala, Govindasamy/0000-0002-3079-0600; Hidalgo, Hugo G./0000-0003-4638-0742; Wood, Andrew/0000-0002-6231-0085; Bonfils, Celine/0000-0002-4674-5708","U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Program of Climate Model Diagnoses and Intercomparison (PCMDI) [DOE-W-7405-ENG-48]; International Detection and Attribution Group (IDAG); U.

The objectives of this research are to contextualize these experiences and to provide valuable information that allows us to understand the types of organizations that participated, as well as some of the activities carried over these seventeen years. This research was carried out based on the archives and private collections kept by a number of Chilean artists. A documentary analysis of this material was carried out, as well as the use of theoretical concepts to critically address those materials. The experiences of cultural coordinators analyzed in the paper have not been previously studied, and little reference has been made to them in the national scenario; as such, this article aims to contribute to this documentary gap of the period.","[Varas, Paulina E.] Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Andres Bello,"Varas, PE (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,"PONTIFICIA UNIV JAVERIANA, FAC ARTES",BOGOTA,"CARRERA 7 NO 40-62, EDIF PABLO VI PISO 2, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA",1794-6670,2215-9959,,CUAD MUSIC ARTES ESC,Cuad.

We explore projections of NA TS changes over the twenty-first century by applying a statistical downscaling methodology(2,3) to a suite of experiments with the latest state-of-the-art global coupled climate models(4). We also apply a methodology(5) to partition the dominant sources of uncertainty in the TS projections. We find that over the first half of the twenty-first century radiative forcing changes act to increase NA TS frequency; this increase arises from radiative forcings other than increasing CO2 (probably aerosols). However, NA IS trends over the entire twenty-first century are of ambiguous sign. We find that for NA TS frequency, in contrast to sea surface temperature (SST), the largest uncertainties are driven by the chaotic nature of the climate system and by the climate response to radiative forcing. These results highlight the need to better understand the processes controlling patterns of SST change in response to radiative forcing and internal climate variability to constrain, estimates of future NA IS activity. Coordinated experiments isolating forcing agents in projections should improve our understanding, and would enable better assessment of future TS activity.","[Villarini, Gabriele] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Villarini, Gabriele] Willis Res Network, London EC3M 7DQ, England; [Vecchi, Gabriel A.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA",Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Villarini, G (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",gvillari@princeton.edu,"Vecchi, Gabriel/A-2413-2008; Villarini, Gabriele/F-8069-2016","Vecchi, Gabriel/0000-0002-5085-224X; Villarini, Gabriele/0000-0001-9566-2370",Willis Research Network,Willis Research Network,"We are grateful for comments from K.

In the past few decades, numerous residential projects constructed in the region have led to higher energy demand for the residential sector. In addition, the growing rate of urbanization and changes in lifestyles caused a significant increase in domestic energy consumption and in Oman, during the period from 2012 to 2018, peak electricity demand is expected to grow at 8% per year compared to the global average rate of 2.5%. This rapid increase in energy consumption has highlighted the need for energy solutions to overcome its excessive consumption. Since the residential sector consumes 48% of total electricity, the main source of energy in Oman, reducing domestic energy use has the potential to reduce the country's total energy consumption. This research aims to evaluate experimentally the key Low Carbon Building (LCB) strategies and criteria best suited to the economic, climatic and social constraints for the hot humid climate of Oman that can be implemented in their future residential sector. For the purpose of this research, the energy performance of reference exemplar state of the art low carbon buildings available in the country, will be compared to selected examples of conventional buildings located within 15 km from the reference buildings. Six key performance parameters of energy consumption in the LCB; lighting, domestic electronic appliances, air conditioning (HVAC), hot water, refrigerators and wash machine, were monitored and recorded, whereas the energy consumption for the same parameters in the conventional buildings were calculated by energy audit. Building energy consumption patterns and performance were monitored and calculated. Based on the data collected, the domestic building energy consumption and energy performance index (EPI) for residential buildings were calculated. Then the modeled energy saving and CO2 emission reductions that may be achieved by implementing LCB strategies on conventional building were evaluated using IES virtual environment software.","[Al Shamsi, Yahya] Univ Bath, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Al Shamsi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Bath, Avon, England.",,,,Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training,Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training,"I would like to acknowledge my sincere gratitude to The Research Council (TRC) in Oman for providing required measurements and data for reference LCB.

Apocalypses, such as the Anthropocene, climate change, and mass extinction require-like the Second World War that Woolf refused to simplify-a tentative search for knowledge, not controlling and predictable methods in the search for a solution. The article is based on how Jacques Derrida's discussion with Immanuel Kant regarding how truth should sound before the apocalypse over the years has increasingly come to describe contemporary doxa, within which there is only room for mystagogues, who inaugurate followers in the real truth behind fake news, or scientisticists, who believe that facts and truth are the same thing. When Derrida shows how these two positions depend on each other, sharing the modern belief that knowledge is associated with development, boundaries and control, he also shows how this narrows knowledge down to the predictable, and, thus, makes it complicit with the mistaken efforts of control responsible for today's challenges. Against this background, the article analyzes works by the artist, Eva Lofdahl, and links them with questions concerning connections between truth, knowledge, art, and science.","[Johansson, Anders E.] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden",Mid-Sweden University,"Johansson, AE (corresponding author), Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden.",Anders.E.Johansson@miun.se,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0787,,HUMANITIES-BASEL,Humanities-Basel,DEC,2021,4,,,,,,128,10.3390/h10040128,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/h10040128,,,10,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,XY7YW,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000737184300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Clouds control Earth's radiation balance, atmospheric water vapour is the strongest 'greenhouse' gas, and non-equilibrium relative humidity at the air-sea interface drives evaporation and latent heat export from the ocean. In this paper, we examine the climatologically relevant atmospheric relative humidity, noting fundamental deficiencies in the definition of this key observable. The metrological history of this quantity is reviewed, problems with its current definition and measurement practice are analysed, and options for future improvements are discussed in conjunction with the recent seawater standard TEOS-10. It is concluded that the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), in cooperation with the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS), along with other international organizations and institutions, can make significant contributions by developing and recommending state-of-the-art solutions, such as are suggested here, for what are long-standing metrological problems.","[Lovell-Smith, J.

The daily precipitation records of 49 gage stations were divided into five regions. Of the five general circulation models studied, two of them were selected based on their performance to simulate local-scale precipitation characteristics. All regions studied, except the interior desert region of the country, could experience fewer wet days in the future, with the most significant decreases estimated in southern Oman. The contribution from the cold frontal troughs to the PTOT in the northeast coastal region would decrease from 85% in the 1985-2004 period to 79% during the 2040-2059 period and further decrease to 77% during the 2080-2099 period. In contrast, results depict enhanced tropical cyclone activities in the northeast coastal region during the post-monsoon period. Despite the decreases in the NWD, PTOT in all regions would increase by 6-29% and 35-67% during the 2040-2059 and 2080-2099 periods, respectively. These results, therefore, show that increases in precipitation intensity dominate the changes in PTOT.","[Gunawardhana, Luminda Niroshana; Al-Rawas, Ghazi A.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Civil & Architectural Engn Dept, Coll Engn, POB 50 Al Khod, Muscat 123, Oman; [Kwarteng, Andy Y.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Remote Sensing & GIS Ctr, Muscat, Oman; [Al-Wardy, Malik] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Agr & Marine Sci, Soils Water & Agr Engn Dept, Muscat, Oman; [Charabi, Yassine] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Dept Geog, Coll Arts & Social Sci, Muscat, Oman",Sultan Qaboos University; Sultan Qaboos University; Sultan Qaboos University; Sultan Qaboos University,"Gunawardhana, LN (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Civil & Architectural Engn Dept, Coll Engn, POB 50 Al Khod, Muscat 123, Oman.",luminda@squ.edu.om,"Charabi, Yassine/E-4121-2013; Al-Wardy, Malik/AAG-8048-2019; Gunawardhana, Luminda/AAF-1437-2019","Charabi, Yassine/0000-0003-2054-688X; Al-Wardy, Malik/0000-0002-9105-2804; Gunawardhana, Luminda/0000-0002-3617-5967",National Strategy for Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change project from Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman [CR/ART/GEOG/14/01],National Strategy for Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change project from Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman,This study was supported by the National Strategy for Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change project (CR/ART/GEOG/14/01) from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman.,,26,3,3,0,1,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

UV irradiation is the most important environmental genotoxic agent. Thus, how elevated UV irradiation may influence human health and ecosystems has generated wide concern in the scientific community, as well as with policy makers and the public in general. In this study, we investigated patterns and mechanisms of UV adaptation in natural ecosystems by studying a gene-specific variation in the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. We compared the sequence characteristics of radiation sensitive 23 (RAD23), a gene involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and UV tolerance, in P. infestans isolates sampled from various altitudes. We found that lower genetic variation in the RAD23 gene was caused by natural selection. The hypothesis that UV irradiation drives this selection was supported by strong correlations between the genomic characteristics and altitudinal origin (historic UV irradiation) of the RAD23 sequences with UV tolerance of the P. infestans isolates. These results indicate that the RAD23 gene plays an important role in the adaptation of P. infestans to UV stress. We also found that different climatic factors could work synergistically to determine the evolutionary adaptation of species, making the influence of climate change on ecological functions and resilience more difficult to predict. Future attention should aim at understanding the collective impact generated by simultaneous change in several climate factors on species adaptation and ecological sustainability, using state of the art technologies such as experimental evolution, genome-wide scanning, and proteomics.","[Wang, Yan-Ping; Waheed, Abdul; Liu, Shi-Ting; Li, Wen-Yang; Nkurikiyimfura, Oswald; Yang, Lina; Zheng, Luping] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Key Lab Biopesticide & Chem Biol, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lurwanu, Yahuza] Bayero Univ Kano, Dept Crop Protect, Kano 70001, Nigeria; [Wang, Zonghua] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Fujian Univ Key Lab Plant Microbe Interact, Coll Life Sci, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zonghua; Yang, Lina] Minjiang Univ, Inst Oceanog, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Grenville-Briggs, Laura J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Protect Biol, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Zhan, Jiasui] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Bayero University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Minjiang University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Yang, LN; Zheng, LP (corresponding author), Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Key Lab Biopesticide & Chem Biol, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Yang, LN (corresponding author), Minjiang Univ, Inst Oceanog, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China.",2180204012@fafu.edu.cn; waheed90539@gmail.com; shitingliu95@gmail.com; wenyangli96@gmail.com; nk.oswaldo@gmail.com; ylurwanu.cpp@buk.edu.ng; wangzh@fafu.edu.cn; laura.grenville.briggs@slu.se; linayang@fafu.edu.cn; lupingz@fafu.edu.cn; jiasui.zhan@slu.se,"Grenville-Briggs, Laura J/C-3419-2014","Grenville-Briggs, Laura J/0000-0001-5910-3651; Wang, Zonghua/0000-0002-0869-9683",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31901861],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 31901861).,,84,2,2,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2309-608X,,J FUNGI,J.

Mechanistic understanding of ecological responses requires the separation of different climatic parameters and processes that often operate on diverse spatiotemporal scales. Yet most environmental studies do not distinguish the effects of internal climate variability from those caused by external, natural (e.g. volcanic, solar, orbital) or anthropogenic (e.g. greenhouse gases, ozone, aerosols, land-use) forcing factors. We suggest extending the climatological concept of 'Detection and Attribution' (DA) to unravel abiotic drivers of ecological dynamics in the Anthropocene. We therefore apply DA to quantify the relative roles of natural versus industrial temperature change on elevational shifts in the outbreak epicentres of the larch budmoth (LBM;Zeiraphera dinianaorgriseanaGn.); the classic example of a cyclic forest defoliating insect. Our case study shows that anthropogenic warming shifts the epicentre of travelling LBM waves upward, which disrupts the intensity of population outbreaks that occurred regularly over the past millennium in the European Alps. Our findings demonstrate the ability of DA to detect ecological responses beyond internal system variability, to attribute them to specific external climate forcing factors and to identify climate-induced ecological tipping points. In order to implement the climatological concept of 'Detection and Attribution' successfully into modern global change ecology, future studies should combine high-resolution paleoenvironmental reconstructions and state-of-the-art climate model simulations to inform inference-based ecosystem models.

J,"Tostoes, A",,,,"Tostoes, Ana",,,FANTASY MUST BE BROUGHT BACk INTO ARCHITECTURE,RA-REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Art; Architecture; Africa; Modern Movement,,"Pancho Guedes(1) (1925), the luso-african architect (Witwatersrand University, 1953) active in Mozambique, the former Portuguese colony till the independence in 1975, made in his writings and architectural production a major contribution to the reassessment of architectural modernity, connecting different disciplines and cultures and carrying out affinities with various creators namely with the painter Malangatana Ngwenya (1936-2009). His fantastic and magic architecture comes from the stimulus of a large worldwide network of artists and thinkers that he himself put up from different sources such as: the Modern Movement architects, namely the South African contributors as Martiessen or the Brazilian inspiring influence referred to Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer; Frank Lloyd Wright inspiring legacy or the CIAM's critic contestation movement under the scope of Team 10 which he joined as founder member at CIAM's Royaumont meeting together with the Smithson's, Aldo Van Eyck, Candilis and Giancarlo di Carlo; or finally the new African artists which he promoted. Besides being one of Mozambique's major architects, Pancho had the sagacity to detect talent, to promote creativity, having the ability to establish a network of creative(2), functioning himself as a sort of mediator between art and architecture.In Lourenco Marques (currently Maputo) Pancho created a profound complicity with Malangatana, the surrealist painter, whom inventive spirit allowed no limits(3). Supernatural summoned, Malangatana stimulated Pancho in his will to ear the voices speaking from the other side of dream(4). In The 50s, in an Africa of Apartheid between Mozambique, Rhodesia and South Africa, Pancho knew that there was the need to found an authentic and raw art, the art for authentic artists(5). Therefore he sought for an Architecture full of significance, carrying a personal dimension based on a research focused on all formal dimensions and on the possibility for architectonical elements to contain and express emotion: I claim for architects to have the same rights and freedom painters and poets have for so long(6). Pancho wanted to appropriate the primitive's universal motifs, mixing them with his own sophisticated architectonical culture, in order to achieve in his buildings the ambience of Chirico's painting. Pancho knew that Architecture is not perceived as an intellectual experience but as a sensation, an emotion(7). Therefore he was interested in the quest for such quality long ago lost among architects but able to reach a spontaneous architecture capable of magic intensity(8). In the 50s, this search resulted from the desire to create an alternative modernity, different from the mechanical international style growing also in Africa(9). Unlike the majority of architects working in Africa forced to draw in dialogue to climate constrains, Pancho assumes the creator's right to innocence stimulated by the sensuality and drama of the surrounding African culture. The creation and growth of Dori(10) and Pancho African art collection, which has been recently exhibited in Lisbon, bears witness to his constant interest in the dialogue with other forms of expression(11). The objects he collected, as he himself has stated, helped him free himself from the dominant Eurocentric point of view of the white man who lives in the land of others(12). The will to discover an alternative modernity was the answer to an inner appeal, but also to an Africa dawning to contemporaneity, to a new world which was in a state of ferment(13). Pancho witness and acts in a time when Architecture is open to popular culture, when architecture without architects and architecture of fantasy are accepted(14). But it is also the time for complexity and multiple solutions opened to the Modern Movement continuity or crises(15), the ones Giedion identified as a result from reason and emotion related equation(16). Pancho gathered the conditions to follow an alternative, original and idiosyncratic path of his own. Besides his huge talent, wide culture, experimentalist and genuine curiosity, he had the term of living in Africa at the time: conditions he managed with cleverness. On one hand being apart from the Eurocentric European culture spreader, living in Africa in an European imperialistic peculiar colony(17); on the other hand, living the period of colonial emancipation spreading throughout Africa, where, despite the imperialistic presence anything seemed possible(18). As Pomar states Pancho was one of the most inventive of the architects that were building in Africa, as well as one of the three or four recognised white mediators who sought out and promoted contemporary African art in various places on the continent. Lourenco Marques was, at the time (in the early 1960s and before the surge of arrests that followed the start of the war for independence), a dynamic city and one of Africa's cultural capitals, due, by and large, to Pancho's international contacts in areas with quicker communicability with the outside world, such as architecture and the visual arts(19).","[Tostoes, Ana] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal; [Tostoes, Ana] Univ Lisbon, Programas Doctorado, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Tostoes, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.;Tostoes, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Programas Doctorado, Lisbon, Portugal.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,1,5,UNIV NAVARRA,PAMPLONA,"UNIV NAVARRA, PAMPLONA, NAVARRA E-31080, SPAIN",1138-5596,2254-6332,,RA-REV ARQUIT,Ra-Rev.

Historical reconstructions since 1850 lasting for >150 years are considered in order to identify coherences between the overturning stream function and surface wind, river runoff, major Baltic inflows, salinity, and water temperature. Long-term time series are evaluated statistically for several subbasins of the Baltic Sea for the two different models and for the sensitivity experiments concerning the interannual, multidecadal, and centennial variability. We found that the simulated overturning circulation has a response time scale with respect to wind or runoff of around 30 years. The overturning circulation will decrease basin-wide under anomalous wind conditions which hamper the deep water flow within the Baltic Sea, under a warmer climate or when river runoff increases. However, a global sea level rise would reinforce the overturning circulation. Overall, multidecadal variations of the overturning circulation are anticorrelated to and caused by the wind parallel to the cross-section of the overturning circulation. They are not caused by river runoff and the coherence with major Baltic inflows is small. Hence, the overturning circulation does not act as a good proxy for major Baltic inflows.","[Placke, Manja; Meier, H. E.

The authors find that the simulation of the present-day mean cloud climatology for this region in the GCMs is very poor and that the cloud-climate feedbacks vary widely among the GCMs. By contrast, iRAM simulates mean clouds and interannual cloud variations that are quite similar to those observed in this region. The model also simulates well the observed relationship between lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and low-level cloud amount. To investigate cloud-climate feedbacks in iRAM, several global warming scenarios were run with boundary conditions appropriate for late twenty-first-century conditions. All the global warming cases simulated with iRAM show a distinct reduction in low-level cloud amount, particularly in the stratocumulus regime, resulting in positive local feedback parameters in these regions in the range of 4-7 W m(-2) K-1. Domain-averaged (30 degrees S-30 degrees N, 150 degrees-60 degrees W) feedback parameters from iRAM range between +1.8 and +1.9 W m(-2) K-1. At most locations both the LTS and cloud amount are altered in the global warming cases, but the changes in these variables do not follow the empirical relationship found in the present-day experiments. The cloud-climate feedback averaged over the same east Pacific region was also calculated from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B simulations for each of the 16 GCMs with results that varied from -1.0 to +1.3 W m(-2) K-1, all less than the values obtained in the comparable iRAM simulations. The iRAM results by themselves cannot be connected definitively to global climate feedbacks; however, among the global GCMs the cloud feedback in the full tropical-subtropical zone is correlated strongly with the east Pacific cloud feedback, and the cloud feedback largely determines the global climate sensitivity. The present iRAM results for cloud feedbacks in the east Pacific provide some support for the high end of current estimates of global climate sensitivity.","[Lauer, Axel; Hamilton, Kevin; Wang, Yuqing] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Hamilton, Kevin; Wang, Yuqing; Phillips, Vaughan T.

Vineyards and olive groves are part of the economic base of this region, contributing to the regional commercial budget and the livelihood of its residents. Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on these crops, where climatic conditions are already very warm and dry, posing a key threat to the olive oil and winemaking sectors. The present study analyzes the impact of climate change on the potential yield of these two crops over the Coa region. For this purpose, two crop models were initialized and ran with state-of-the art spatial datasets for climate, soil, terrain, and plant data. As outputs of the crop models, potential yields of grapevines and olive trees were obtained for the recent-past (1981-2005) and for the future (2041-2070), under two climatic scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results (potential yield) were then normalized, taking into account the recent-past maximum yields and divided into four classes (low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high). For the recent-past, the results of the crop models present a high agreement with the current location of vineyards and olive groves. For the future, two different types of impacts (positive and negative) are found for the two crops. For olive trees, the results show promising future improvements in possible expansion areas within the Coa region. However, for grapevines, the results show a decrease in potential yields throughout the region, including a strong shift of producing moderate zones to low potentials. Nonetheless, these results also suggest that the negative impacts of climate change can be alleviated by the application of suitable adaptation measures, based on changing certain management practices, even in the more severe future scenario. Therefore, these measures should be carefully planned and implemented in a timely fashion by farmers.","[Fraga, Helder; Guimaraes, Nathalie; Freitas, Teresa R.; Malheiro, Aureliano C.; Santos, Joao A.] Univ Tras Os Montes Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro,"Fraga, H (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes Alto Douro UTAD, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci CITAB, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal.",hfraga@utad.pt; nsguimaraes@utad.pt; trfreitas@utad.pt; amalheir@utad.pt; jsantos@utad.pt,"Santos, João Andrade/G-8805-2011; Malheiro, Aureliano C./H-6155-2011; Malheiro, Aureliano C./AAV-6852-2020; Fraga, Helder/D-8507-2012","Santos, João Andrade/0000-0002-8135-5078; Malheiro, Aureliano C./0000-0001-6606-1787; Malheiro, Aureliano C./0000-0001-6606-1787; Fraga, Helder/0000-0002-7946-8786; Guimaraes, Nathalie/0000-0002-0636-1099; Freitas, Teresa Raquel/0000-0001-5209-0237","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [COA/CAC/0030/2019, UIDB/04033/2020, LA/P/0126/2020, CEECIND/00447/2017, UI/BD/150727/2020]; European Union's Horizon 2020 [810176]",Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); European Union's Horizon 2020,"The work was supported by the CoaClimateRisk project (COA/CAC/0030/2019) financed by National Funds by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).

However, the historical trends of terrestrial GPP, due to the CO2 fertilization effect, climate, and land-use change, remain largely uncertain. Using long-term satellite-based near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRv), a proxy for GPP, and multiple GPP datasets derived from satellite-based products, dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) simulations, and an upscaled product from eddy covariance (EC) measurements, here we comprehensively investigated their trends and analyzed the causes for any discrepancies during 1982-2015. Although spatial patterns of climatological annual GPP from all products and NIRv are highly correlated (r > 0.84), the spatial correlation coefficients of trends between DGVM GPP and NIRv significantly decreased (with the ensemble mean of r = 0.49) and even the spatial correlation coefficients of trends between other GPP products and NIRv became negative. By separating the global land into the tropics plus extratropical Southern Hemisphere (Trop CSH) and extratropical Northern Hemisphere (NH), we found that, during 1982-2015, simulated GPP from most of the models showed a stronger increasing trend over Trop CSH than NH. In contrast, the satellite-based GPP products indicated a substantial increase over NH. Mechanistically, model sensitivity experiments indicated that the increase of annual global total GPP was dominated by the CO2 fertilization effect (83.9% contribution), however, with the largest uncertainty in magnitude in individual simulations among the three drivers of CO2 fertilization, climate, and land-use change. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of inter-model spreads of GPP trends resulted mainly from climate and land-use change rather than CO2 fertilization effect. After 2000, trends from satellite-based GPP products were different from the full time series, suggesting weakened rising trends over NH and even significantly decreasing trends over Trop CSH, while the trends from DGVMs and NIRv kept increasing. The inconsistencies of GPP trends are very likely caused by the contrasting performance between satellite-derived and DGVM simulated vegetation structure parameter (leaf area index, LAI). Therefore, the uncertainty in satellite-based GPP products induced by highly uncertain LAI data in the tropics undermines their roles in assessing the performance of DGVM simulations and understanding the changes of global carbon sinks. The higher consistency between DGVM GPP and NIRv suggests that the trends from a DGVM ensemble might even have better performance than satellite-based GPP products.","[Yang, Ruqi; Zeng, Ning; Tang, Wenhan; Cai, Qixiang; Liu, Di; Han, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ruqi; Tang, Wenhan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun] Nanjing Univ, Frontiers Sci Ctr Crit Earth Mat Cycling, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Ning] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zeng, Ning] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [McGrath, Matthew Joseph] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Commissariat Energie Atom & Energies Alternat CNR, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Lombardozzi, Danica] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Tian, Hanqin] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 105 S Gregory Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Han, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Carbon Neutral Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Exeter; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Wang, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Frontiers Sci Ctr Crit Earth Mat Cycling, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wangjun@nju.edu.cn,"Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012; Jain, Atul/D-2851-2016; Zeng, Ning/A-3130-2008","Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091; Jain, Atul/0000-0002-4051-3228; Zeng, Ning/0000-0002-7489-7629; Wang, Jun/0000-0001-7359-1647","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0504000, 2020YFA0607504, 2021YFB3901001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41807434]; H2020 European Research Council [776810]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); H2020 European Research Council,"This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant nos. 2017YFB0504000, 2020YFA0607504, and 2021YFB3901001), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41807434).

In a collaborative inquiry into the practices of two youth media producers, we explore how these counternarrative efforts are forms of restorying, in which young people write themselves into existence in ways that can reconfigure school spaces. Framed in Black feminist and critical cosmopolitan perspectives, this article considers how young people use new media tools in school to engage the narrative imagination and build the worlds they want to live in, simultaneously representing the political histories and realities of their everyday worlds and imagining alternative futures.

Effectively functioning hospitals are critical to a community's resilience to the adverse health impacts of such events. Yet many hospitals have not been designed with extreme weather risks in mind and are built in flood-prone areas, raising concerns about their ability to support community healthcare needs when they eventuate. While considerable research has been conducted on developing disaster responses to maintain healthcare services in the face of floods, there is a paucity of research on hospital evacuating planning. Addressing this critical gap in research, this paper explores current state-of-the-art hospital evacuation transportation models to identify key factors for developing more effective evacuation planning for future flooding risks. A new modelling framework is proposed, which addresses the limitations of existing hospital evacuation models and proposes factors that should be incorporated into future models to enhance community resilience to growing flood risks due to climate change.","[Yazdani, Maziar; Mojtahedi, Mohammad; Sanderson, David] Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Loosemore, Martin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Yazdani, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",Maziar.yazdani@unsw.edu.au,,"Sanderson, David/0000-0003-0398-4343; Loosemore, Martin/0000-0002-3189-4655",,,,,90,21,21,8,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-0617,,,PROG DISASTER SCI,Prog.

Based on decision making model, different halls were classified in terms of action level. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate ergonomic risk factors in an industrial company using assessment of repetitive tasks (ART) method and to make priority of salons to implement corrective actions based on the results of the ELECTRE method. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study consisted all employees working in seven halls of an ark opal manufacturing (n = 240) and 13 tasks were included. Required information were gathered by demographic questionnaire and assessment of repetitive tasks (ART) method for repetitive task assessment. In addition, ELECTRE method was used to prioritize the studied halls. SPSS version 20 and MATLAB were used for analysis. Results: The total ART score was equal to 30.07 +/- 12.43. Data analysis from ART illustrated that 74.6% of 240 cases were in high and 13.8% were in medium level of risk. ART-ELECTRE results revealed that grading and pars naghsh halls were in the best and decoration hall was in the worst ergonomic conditions and should be placed in the top priority of action level. Conclusions: The obtained results showed that the ELECTRE method can be used for ergonomic and human factor engineering challenges successfully. It seems that macro-and micro-ergonomic solutions along with employee's participation, based on the scientific decision-making procedures, can lead to effectiveness in health level enhancement of industrial settings increasingly.","[Khandan, Mohammad] Qom Univ Med Sci, Hlth Fac, Ergon Dept, Qom, Iran; [Koohpaei, Alireza] Qom Univ Med Sci, Work Hlth Res Ctr, Hlth Fac, Dept Occupat Hlth, Qom, Iran",,"Koohpaei, A (corresponding author), Qom Univ Med Sci, Work Hlth Res Ctr, Hlth Fac, Dept Occupat Hlth, Qom, Iran.",koohpaei19@yahoo.com,"koohpaei, alireza/H-9103-2016",,,,,,36,1,1,0,8,KOWSAR PUBL,HOENSBROEK,"PATERSWEG 22,, HOENSBROEK, LIMBURG 6431 GC, NETHERLANDS",2251-8959,2251-9513,,HEALTH SCOPE,Health Scope,NOV,2016,4,,,,,,e34901,10.17795/jhealthscope-34901,http://dx.doi.org/10.17795/jhealthscope-34901,,,7,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",EF1OF,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000390093500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we conducted the following analyses at the regional and national scales: (1) how and when did the study of ecosystem services arise in each country?, (2) what is our present understanding of ecosystem service supply, delivery to societies, and social and economic values?, (3) what is the state of the art in integrating tradeoffs among services and in using interdisciplinary perspectives?, and (4) how has ecosystem service research been connected to policy design or management for sustainability? A large literature review ( > 1000 references) showed that in Latin America ES supply and links to policy have been the most frequently assessed. Overall, emphasis has been placed on a few services, namely carbon and water. Payments for ecosystem services have received considerable attention in the region, though with strong differences across nations and with important limitations in their application. The future of the ecosystem service paradigm in Latin America will largely depend on its capacity to demonstrate effectiveness in meeting both conservation and development goals.

However, existing studies are limited in individual sites, and large-scale mapping of coastal wetland degradation patterns over a long period is rare. Our study developed a new framework to detect spatial and temporal patterns of coastal wetland degradation by analyzing fine-scale, long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Then, this framework was tested to track the degradation of coastal wetlands at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, United States, during the period from 1995 to 2019. We identified six types of coastal wetland degradation in the study area. Most of the detected degradation was located within 2 km from the shoreline and occurred in the past five years. Further, we used a state-of-the-art coastal hydrologic model, PIHM-Wetland, to investigate key hydrologic processes/variables that control the coastal wetland degradation. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion confirmed the location and timing of wetland degradation detected by remote sensing. The combined method also quantified the possible critical thresholds of water tables for wetland degradation. The remote sensing-hydrologic model integrated scheme proposed in this study provides a new tool for detecting and understanding coastal wetland degradation mechanisms. Our study approach can also be extended to other coastal wetland regions to understand how climate change and sea-level rise impact wetland transformations.","[He, Keqi; Li, Wenhong] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Earth & Climate Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Zhang, Yu] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Sun, Ge; McNulty, Steve] USDA Forest Serv, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Southern Res Stn, Raleigh, NC 27709 USA",Duke University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Li, WH (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Earth & Climate Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",keqi.he@duke.edu; yuzhang@lanl.gov; wenhongli@duke.edu; ge.sun@usda.gov; steven.mcnulty@usda.gov,"Zhang, Yu/ABC-4624-2021","Zhang, Yu/0000-0002-9263-8428; Li, Wenhong/0000-0002-5990-2004; He, Keqi/0000-0001-5793-8583; Sun, Ge/0000-0002-0159-1370",Duke Graduate Student Training Enhancement Grants; Duke Nicholas School Dean's Research Fund; United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (USDA-FS),Duke Graduate Student Training Enhancement Grants; Duke Nicholas School Dean's Research Fund; United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (USDA-FS),"This research was funded by Duke Graduate Student Training Enhancement Grants (GSTEG) for Summer 2020 and Duke Nicholas School Dean's Research Fund.

Adaptability of transparent components and facade integration of renewable energy harvesters are being widely studied. However, opaque facade components are less developed, even if their performance can be further optimized. When searching responsive technologies to propose new opaque facades, we learned they were usually created for other fields, which hampers their direct application in new envelopes. The successful implementation of these technologies in fa ade industry depends on the fulfilment of diverse requirements, such as durability, security or flexibility in design among others, but this information was not easy to get when they were not developed for the built environment. There is a lack of empirical studies evaluating these characteristics for adaptive technologies, which are mandatory to define the technical specifications of a fa ade. However, literature review provides a great amount of qualitative information and this study uses it for its analysis in order to gain insights into the degree of accomplishments of aforementioned requirements. Analysed technologies were kinetic elements, shifting thermal behaviour elements, dynamic components and systems. Overall, they still need to face several technical challenges for their suitable fa ade application. The novel visual analysis proposed in this paper is an useful tool for researchers undertaking this task, as it allows a fast and holistic comparison of the potentials and weaknesses of the dynamic technologies. It was concluded that a suitable combination among them could help to achieve the broad functionalities of the facades.","[Juaristi, Miren; Monge-Barrio, Aurora] Univ Navarra, Sch Architecture, Campus Univ, Navarra 31009, Spain; [Gomez-Acebo, Tomas] Univ Navarra, TECNUN Sch Engineers, Manuel de Lardizabal 15, San Sebastian 20018, Spain",University of Navarra; University of Navarra,"Juaristi, M (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Sch Architecture, Campus Univ, Navarra 31009, Spain.",mjuaristi@alumni.unav.es,"Monge, Aurora/AAC-3585-2019; Gómez-Acebo, Tomás/B-1231-2008","Gómez-Acebo, Tomás/0000-0001-6559-1313; Monge-Barrio, Aurora/0000-0003-4928-8773; Juaristi Gutierrez, Miren/0000-0001-8760-1746",COST Action [TU1403],COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This paper is part of the ongoing PhD research project titled Adaptive Opaque Fa ades: a design and assessment method, funded through a scholarship granted by Asociacion de Amigos of the Universidad de Navarra, Spain.

It investigates how music festival communities are constructed with a focus on what role, if any, they might play in responding to the global challenge of environmental sustainability. Using music festivals in Scotland as a case study, we employed a variety of research methods to interrogate different constituents in music festival communities about their views and behaviours regarding climate change and environmental sustainability. These included festival audiences via onsite questionnaires; festival organisers and promoters via interviews and focus groups; and musicians via creative practice-led research. We conclude that rather than necessarily being a site for progressive or utopian socio-cultural experimentation (as they are occasionally portrayed in festival literature), music festival communities engage in complex and often contradictory behaviours when it comes to responding to - and making sense of - their own complicity in social challenges such as climate change.","[Brennan, Matt] Univ Glasgow, Sch Culture & Creat Arts, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Scott, Jo Collinson] Univ West Scotland, Sch Creat & Cultural Ind, Ayr, Scotland; [Connelly, Angela] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Lawrence, Gemma] Creat Carbon Scotland, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Manchester,"Brennan, M (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Culture & Creat Arts, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",matt.brennan@glasgow.ac.uk; Jo.Collinson-Scott@uws.ac.uk; Angela.Connelly-2@manchester.ac.uk; gemma.lawrence@creativecarbonscotland.com,"Connelly, Angela/AAG-5127-2019","Scott, Jo Collinson/0000-0002-5317-0375; Connelly, Angela/0000-0003-1040-8678",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/M009270/1]; AHRC [AH/M009270/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The research underpinning this article was made possible thanks to an Arts and Humanities Research Council grant, Fields of Green: Addressing Sustainability and Climate Change through Music Festival Communities, AH/M009270/1.

However, the road transport system is complex and the potential impacts of these vehicles, which could contribute to totally reshape the vehicle use paradigm, are mostly uncertain and could even have undesirable consequences. A significant increase in travel demand is foreseen to occur as these vehicles provide more comfort and a greater accessibility to user groups such as the elderly, young or disabled. This circumstance might require a totally different management of the road transport system. From higher levels of coordination up to the complete control of the system as it already happens in other transport systems like aviation and, in part, maritime, might be required to ensure that the performances of the road system will not gradually collapse. In spite of the potential negative implications of a large-scale deployment of automated vehicles, Public Authorities are mainly focusing their attention on providing the framework in which industry and operators can deploy new technologies and systems. However, as soon as the share of vehicles with higher degrees of automation will increase, the need for different approaches to traffic monitoring and control will immediately emerge. In the present paper the concept of Coordinated Automated Road Transport (C(2)ART) is presented as an evolution of the road transport management concept in the presence of connected and automated vehicles. The objective of the present work is to collect in a structured way the state of the current knowledge and practice in order to frame different future scenarios that can help policy makers to better plan their strategy as well as assist the academic world to support the evolution by providing the tools that are necessary in the attempt to implement a fully Automated Road Transport system.","[Raposo, Maria Alonso; Ciuffo, Biagio; Makridis, Michail; Thiel, Christian] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Energy C, Transport & Climate Sustainable Transport Unit, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ciuffo, B (corresponding author), European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Energy C, Transport & Climate Sustainable Transport Unit, Ispra, Italy.",biagio.ciuffo@ec.europa.eu,"Makridis, Michail/Q-6506-2017","Makridis, Michail/0000-0001-7462-4674",,,,,47,5,5,1,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6484-7,,,,2017,,,,,7,12,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Transportation Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Transportation,BJ6LO,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000426813700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only regarding the environmental impact, the application of these biological coatings on buildings has the potential of acting as a thermal, moisture, noise, and electromagnetic barrier. At the urban scale, they might reduce the heat island effect and sewage system load, improve runoff water and air quality, and reconstruct natural landscapes including wildlife. In spite of these significant benefits, the current design and construction methods are not completely regulated by law because there is a lack of knowledge of their technical performance. Hence, this review of the current state of the art presents a proper green roof classification based on their components and vegetation layer. Similarly, a detailed description from the key factors that control the hydraulic and thermal performance of green roofs is given. Based on these factors, an estimation of the impact of green roof systems on sustainable construction certifications is included (i.e., LEED-Leadership in Energy and Environment Design, BREEAM-Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method, CASBEE-Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency, BEAM-Building Environmental Assessment Method, ESGB-Evaluation Standard for Green Building).

We undertake a systematic sensitivity analysis to disentangle the effect of the time-invariant baseline residence time (k) and the sensitivity of microbial decomposition to temperature (Q(10)) on soil carbon dynamics at regional and global scales. Our simulations produce a range in total soil carbon at equilibrium of similar to 592 to 2745 Pg C, which is similar to the similar to 561 to 2938 PgC range in pre-industrial soil carbon in models used in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This range depends primarily on the value of k, although the impact of Q(10) is not trivial at regional scales. As climate changes through the historical period, and into the future, k is primarily responsible for the magnitude of the response in soil carbon, whereas Q(10) determines whether the soil remains a sink, or becomes a source in the future mostly by its effect on mid-latitude carbon balance. If we restrict our simulations to those simulating total soil carbon stocks consistent with observations of current stocks, the projected range in total soil carbon change is reduced by 42% for the historical simulations and 45% for the future projections. However, while this observation-based selection dismisses outliers, it does not increase confidence in the future sign of the soil carbon feedback. We conclude that despite this result, future estimates of soil carbon and how soil carbon responds to climate change should be more constrained by available data sets of carbon stocks.","[Exbrayat, J. -F.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Exbrayat, J. -F.] Univ Edinburgh, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Exbrayat, J. -F.; Pitman, A.

We developed count-based models to identify abiotic and biotic variables explaining annual spruce establishment over 20-30 years following silvicultural regeneration treatments across 24 spruce stands in Colorado. Covariates retained in our final model encompassed information on climate, physiography, stand structure, and time. Establishment was positively related to germination- and second-year frost-free period beginning dates, indicating that moisture limitations at early life stages may be alleviated by longer retention of snowpack. Yet, recruits were positively influenced by both lengthier frost-free periods and lower heat-moisture indices, suggesting a tension between growing-season length and moisture limitations for physiological maturation, lasting 5 years after germination. Establishment was also limited by higher elevations and lower solar radiation, further suggesting cold limitations in these stands. Moreover, overstory basal area negatively influenced recruitment, suggesting an inhibitive effect on light and precipitation availability for seedlings. Our findings extend similar conclusions from harsher treeline environments to high-elevation managed stands but illustrate stronger relative effects of overstory density and cold-related limitations and suggest transitions in climate effects with life stages.","[Hill, Edward; Ex, Seth; Prolic, Curtis] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, 1472 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Aldridge, Cameron] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, 1401 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Hill, E (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, 1472 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",emhill@rams.colostate.edu,,,"McIntire-Stennis [COL00506, 1006421]",McIntire-Stennis,"We would like to express our gratitude in particular for expertise and guidance provided by Art Haines, Drew Stroberg, and Michael Battaglia of the U.S. Forest Service and Jason Sibold of the Department of Anthropology at Colorado State University.

In order to quantify the effects of these fires on regional air quality in East Asia, we used a global chemical transport model (CTM) with a biomass burning emission inventory constrained by satellite. Our focus was mainly on the enhancements of the ozone and aerosol concentrations due to these fires over East Asia. We first evaluated the model extensively by comparing the simulated and the observed ozone and aerosol concentrations at the EANET sites and found that the simulation reproduced the observed variability of those species. However, some discrepancies were found in the model when compared with the MODIS AOD observations. We tested the sensitivity of the model AOD to different injection heights of fire emissions and found that the model with an injection height of 4.5 km was in better agreement with the observations. We then used our model results to quantify the influences of Siberian forest fires on ozone and aerosols concentrations which were computed using the differences between the simulations with and without Siberian forest fire emissions. The peak increases in the surface PM10 and ozone concentrations were up to 90 mu g m(-3) and 33 ppbv, respectively, over Siberia. In the downwind regions, the increases ranged from 5 to 30 mu g m(-3) and from 3 to 20 ppbv for PM10 and ozone concentrations, respectively, having an important implication for air quality over East Asia. Finally, we computed the radiative forcing of aerosols and ozone from the Siberian forest fires as a measure of climate impact. Siberian forest fires were found to act mainly as a cooling agent resulting in a negative radiative forcing of -5.8 W m(-2) at the surface over East Asia. The value at the TOA was -1.5 W m(-2), indicating that a considerable absorption of radiation occurred in the atmosphere. This result implies that the Siberian forest fires may affect the regional climate over East Asia by intensifying atmospheric stability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study is an attempt to provide a detailed review on globalization, green economy, and climate challenges to draw some implications. There are disagreements between competing green economic discourses and a variety of definitions, all of which have problems. Recognizing the environmental effects of natural resource depletion and the economic benefits of environmental management are common examples of green economy operationalization. The new study also examines climate change's impact on the green economy and infrastructure development. The study further considers the role of economic structure to mitigate environmental issues, increase production efficiency, enhance green economy and environmentally friendly technologies. The present study concluded that working toward a green economy helps reduce poverty in the four ways indicated in this study. It also shed a brief light to improves poor people's access to a healthy and safe environment while increasing human security by preventing or resolving conflicts over land, food, water, and other natural resources.","[Zhang, Lin; Xu, Meng; Chen, Huangxin] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuexinyi] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuiguang] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Fuzhou, Peoples R China",Fujian Normal University; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University,"Zhang, L; Chen, HX (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.",Zhanglin_Daniel@163.com; qbx20180005@yjs.fjnu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund General Project [19BGL092]; Innovation Strategy Research Project of Fujian Province [2021R0156]; GF Securities Social Welfare Foundation Teaching; Research Fund for National Finance and Mesoeconomics,National Social Science Fund General Project; Innovation Strategy Research Project of Fujian Province; GF Securities Social Welfare Foundation Teaching; Research Fund for National Finance and Mesoeconomics,"& nbsp;This research was funded by National Social Science Fund General Project (No.19BGL092), Innovation Strategy Research Project of Fujian Province (No. 2021R0156), GF Securities Social Welfare Foundation Teaching and Research Fund for National Finance and Mesoeconomics.",,54,8,8,35,45,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

However, most CMIP5 model simulations with historical radiative forcing do not reproduce this Pacific La Nia-like cooling. Based on the assumption of perfect models, previous studies have suggested that errors in simulated internal climate variations and/or external radiative forcing may cause the discrepancy between the multi-model simulations and the observation. But the exact causes remain unclear. Recent studies have suggested that observed SST warming in the other two ocean basins in past decades and the thermostat mechanism in the Pacific in response to increased radiative forcing may also play an important role in driving this La Nia-like cooling. Here, we investigate an alternative hypothesis that common biases of current state-of-the-art climate models may deteriorate the models' ability and can also contribute to this multi-model simulations-observation discrepancy. Our results suggest that underestimated inter-basin warming contrast across the three tropical oceans, overestimated surface net heat flux and underestimated local SST-cloud negative feedback in the equatorial Pacific may favor an El Nio-like warming bias in the models. Effects of the three common model biases do not cancel one another and jointly explain similar to 50% of the total variance of the discrepancies between the observation and individual models' ensemble mean simulations of the Pacific SST trend. Further efforts on reducing common model biases could help improve simulations of the externally forced climate trends and the multi-decadal climate fluctuations.","[Luo, Jing-Jia] Bur Meteorol, Level 9,700 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia; [Wang, Gang] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Monash University,"Luo, JJ (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Level 9,700 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia.",j.luo@bom.gov.au,"Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019; Dommenget, Dietmar/B-9828-2011","Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Dommenget, Dietmar/0000-0002-5129-7719",ARC project Beyond the linear dynamics of the El Nino Southern Oscillation [DP120101442]; ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate System Science [CE110001028],ARC project Beyond the linear dynamics of the El Nino Southern Oscillation(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate System Science(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank M.

However the changes in daily precipitation and the precipitation extremes during summer monsoon (June through September) season are prominent than during the rest of year. PRECIS simulations under both A2 and B2 scenarios indicate increase in frequency of heavy precipitation events and also enhancement in their intensity towards the end of the 21st century.

Luminescence dating of mud wasp nests overlying Gwion Gwion paintings has confirmed an age of at least 17,000 yrs B.P. with the most recent dates for these paintings from around the mid-Holocene (5000 to 7000 yrs B.P.). Radiocarbon dating indicates that the Wandjina rock art then emerged around 3800 to 4000 yrs B.P. following a hiatus of at least 1200 yrs. Here we show that a mid-Holocene ENSO forced collapse of the Australian summer monsoon and ensuing mega-drought spanning approximately 1500 yrs was the likely catalyst of this change in rock art. The severity of the drought we believe was enhanced through positive feedbacks triggered by change in land surface condition and increased aerosol loading of the atmosphere leading to a weakening or failure of monsoon rains. This confirms that pre-historic aboriginal cultures experienced catastrophic upheaval due to rapid natural climate variability and that current abundant seasonal water supplies may fail again if significant change in ENSO occurs.

In this study, we evaluate and quantify the uncertainties of different contributors to the Antarctic Sea ice mass budget among 15 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Results show that the simulated total Antarctic Sea ice mass budget is primarily adjusted by the basal growth/melting terms, the frazil ice formation term and the snow-ice term, whereas the top melting terms, the lateral melting terms, the dynamic process and the evaporation process play secondary roles. In addition, while recent studies indicated that the contributors of the Arctic Sea ice formation/dissipation processes show strong coherency among different CMIP models, our results revealed a significant model diversity over the Antarctic region, indicating that the uncertainties of the sea ice formation and dissipation are still considerable in these state-of-the-art climate models. The largest uncertainties appear in the snow ice formation, the basal melting and the top melting terms, whose spread among different models is of the same order of magnitude as the multi-model mean. In some models, large positive bias in the snow ice terms may neutralize the strong negative bias of the basal/top melting terms, resulting in a similar value of the total Antarctic Sea ice area compared with other models, yet with an inaccurate physical process. The uncertainties in these Antarctic Sea ice formation/dissipation terms highlight the importance of further improving the sea ice dynamical and parameterization processes in the state-of-the-art models.","[Li, Sirui; Fan, Guangzhou] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Li, Sirui; Huang, Gang; Liu, Jiping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang; Li, Xichen; Liu, Jiping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xichen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chengdu University of Information Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Huang, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Huang, G; Li, XC (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, XC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hg@mail.iap.ac.cn; lixichen@mail.iap.ac.cn,"huang, gang/D-6427-2012","huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605904]; Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences [COMS2019Q03, 2019QZKK0102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41831175, 91937302, 41721004]","National Key R&D Program of China; Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0605904), Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Research of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (COMS2019Q03), STEP (2019QZKK0102), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41831175, 91937302, and 41721004).",,46,3,3,1,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

The utilization of these inorganic insulating materials, is associated with risk in the industrial workplace activities, manufacturing, and installation depending on the exposure to the material. Thus, it is important to use and develop biodegradable organic insulating materials which are easily available, low cost and environment friendly. This study presents the design and fabrication of a flat plate collector solar water heating system using biodegradable forest and agriculture wastes as insulating material. The utilization of pine needles and rice husk as thermal insulation for the fabrication of solar water heaters is the novelty of the study. The innovative solar water heater is tested under different outdoor climatic conditions. Maximum hot water temperatures between 52 degrees C and 55 degrees C were observed with an average efficiency of 52% and 57% with rice husk and pine needles as insulating materials respectively. Experimental analysis is performed using 40 mm, 60 mm and 80 mm pine needle insulation. The optimum pine needles insulation thickness is found to be 60 mm with a maximum hot water temperature of 64 degrees C for the indigenously developed flat plate collector based solar water heater for hill climates.

Emotions are not only a part of educational climate, but the essential aspect of educational process. They form a part of both verbal and non-verbal communication, they are the subject of teaching in art education, but also in the overall human relationships. Emotions can be perceived as love towards one's own profession, towards the subject we work on, towards pupils or students, but also reversely - that of pupils and students towards teacher, subject or profession. Successful teaching is not only based on emotions, it is, as Pestalozzi put it, a unity of head, heart and hand. This paper is the result of the project which has been carried out at three levels: (1) a study into theoretical level of emotions in teaching; (2) a seminar for teachers on the emotions in teaching with the application of a creative approach, collection of teachers' questions about the issues in practice and survey of emotional climate in this form of educational process; and (3) a report on the results of the project and solutions to the problems in practice. The aim of this research has been to apply the so-called lateral thinking onto the issue of emotions in teaching, by using this method in seminars for teachers, while approaching the issue in six different ways: as a process, information, emotionally, critically, optimistically, and creatively. In writing this paper we have also used this approach, which represents a shift from the positivist approach. The obtained results indicate that there is a problem of fierce and uncontrolled emotional reaction in practice, a problem of heavy emotions that are the result of child trauma and unpleasant emotions connected with grading and ranking. It turns out that teaching with the creative technique of 'lateral thinking' cause favourable emotional climate and the seminar participants felt pleasant emotions in 98% cases.","[Bognar, Ladislav; Dubovicki, Snjezana] Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Teacher Educ, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Bognar, L (corresponding author), Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Teacher Educ, Ulica Cara Hadrijana Bb, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",ladislav.bognar@os.t-com.hr; sdubovicki@ufos.hr,"Dubovicki, Snježana/I-3999-2017; Dubovicki, Snjezana/ABE-9526-2020","Dubovicki, Snježana/0000-0003-4770-3371; ",,,,,15,5,5,0,12,FAC TEACHER EDUCATION,ZAGREB,"UNIV ZAGREB, SAVSKA CESTA 77, ZAGREB, 00000, CROATIA",1848-5189,1848-5197,,CROAT J EDUC,Croat.

These two components are linked to one another in varying degrees by regions of strong sensible heating (Indo-Asian landmass) and strong latent heat export (the Western Pacific Warm Pool and the southern subtropical Indian Ocean). Variability within the Indian and East Asian subsystems, interactions among them, and the extent to which they interact with other climate phenomena (e.g., ENSO) are current topics of modern and paleoclimate research. This work provides an overview of past and current paleomonsoon research on tectonic to interannual time scales with a primary focus on marine sediment records. While past and current work has contributed greatly to our understanding of paleomonsoon variability at all time scales, additional efforts are required to make further progress in two critical areas. (1) Additional efforts are needed in terms of proxy development and evaluation, requiring concerted efforts at long-term sediment trap deployments in key monsoon-influenced regions as well as development of adequate and widely available core-top databases. These are necessary to assess the impact of modern oceanographic and seafloor processes on potential monsoon proxies. (2) Additional effort is also needed in acquiring a sufficient geographic distribution of downcore records to assess linkages among the subsystems and their role in the context of extratropical climate change. These records should have high sedimentation rates (including varved sections). This requires substantial survey support to identify the most appropriate coring and drilling targets.

While there is a growing literature on the food practices of 'alternative' consumers, 'mainstream' consumers are less well understood. This paper describes qualitative research undertaken in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area of Sydney, Australia, which aimed to uncover consumer views towards sustainable and healthy diets. Most participants indicated a discrepancy between their desired and actual behaviours: while they want to support Australian, or local, food producers they gravitate towards cheap and tasty food from 'anywhere'; and while they associate nutritious food with fresh food, they will buy processed foods which can be less expensive, appeal to children and are prone to less waste. Reflecting mainstream Australian political culture, participants were compromising household food budgets in order to pursue a socially acceptable standard of living (including decent housing, car-reliance). They were also incorporating the pleasure and desires of family members as part of 'the moral arts of everyday life'. Using social theories of consumption and practice sociology we argue that food choices and practices - easy or not - need to be interpreted as part of the role that consumption plays in political citizenship and moral subjectivity. In the Western Sydney context, food practices are essentially household budget and family nourishment practices rather than nutrition and sustainability practices; a position which is not addressed in the government's new food policies or wage determination processes.

In the context of climate simulation and prediction, it is relevant to obtain an estimate of the range of climate outcomes given the parameter uncertainty. Instead of randomly perturbing parameters, we determine parameter perturbations from short-term integrations that potentially have a high impact on the climate of the model. For this purpose we consider a dry, spectral quasi-geostrophic, three-level model on the sphere and its tangent linear and adjoint equations. With an empirical forcing, the model produces a fairly realistic simulation of the extra-tropical winter circulation. We allowed perturbations in a 1,449 dimensional parameter space. As a measure of impact on the climate we compute the change in the probability density function of the dominant patterns of variability. We find that the largest climate response in a set of 1,000 simulations with potentially high impact perturbations is much larger than the largest response in a similar set of simulations with randomly picked perturbations. We conclude that parameter sensitivity calculations based on short term integrations contain valuable information about the sensitivity of the model climate to parameter perturbations. The approach is feasible for state-of-the-art climate models provided that the tangent linear and adjoint equations are implemented.","[Levine-Moolenaar, Hanneke E.; Grasman, Johan] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands; [Levine-Moolenaar, Hanneke E.; Selten, Frank M.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Grasman, J (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, POB 100, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands.",johan.grasman@wur.nl,,,,,,,31,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

However, the CO2- and climate-sensitivities of GPP vary among models. We applied the 'P model'-a parameter-sparse and extensively tested light use efficiency (LUE) model, driven by CO2, climate and remotely sensed greenness data-at 29 sites with multi-year eddy-covariance flux measurements. Observed (both positive and negative) GPP trends at these sites were predicted, albeit with some bias. Increasing LUE (due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration) and green vegetation cover were the primary controls of modelled GPP trends across sites. Global GPP simulated by the same model increased by 0.46 +/- 0.09 Pg C yr(-2) during 1982-2016. This increase falls in the mid-range rate of simulated increase by the TRENDY v8 ensemble of state-of-the-art ecosystem models. The modelled LUE increase during 1900-2013 was 15%, similar to a published estimate based on deuterium isotopomers. Rising CO2 was the largest contributor to the modelled GPP increase. Greening, which may in part be caused by rising CO2, ranked second but dominated the modelled GPP change over large areas, including semi-arid vegetation on all continents. Warming caused a small net reduction in modelled global GPP, but dominated the modelled GPP increase in high northern latitudes. These findings strengthen the evidence that rising LUE due to rising CO2 level and increased green vegetation cover (fAPAR) are the main causes of increasing GPP, and thereby, the terrestrial carbon sink.","[Cai, Wenjia; Prentice, Iain Colin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Prentice, Iain Colin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Prentice, Iain Colin] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Imperial College London; Tsinghua University; Macquarie University,"Cai, WJ (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",w.cai17@imperial.ac.uk,"Cai, Wenjia/AAI-3660-2021","Cai, Wenjia/0000-0003-0767-9784",CDIAC; OzFlux office; ChinaFlux office; AsiaFlux office; China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201908060024]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [787203 REALM],CDIAC; OzFlux office; ChinaFlux office; AsiaFlux office; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank TRENDY v8 modellers, namely, V Haverd (CABLE-POP), V Arora (CLASS-CTEM), D Lombardozzi (CLM5.0), H Tian (DLEM), A Jain (ISAM), J Nabel (JSBACK), A Wiltshire (JULES), B Poulter (LPJ), P Anthoni (LPJ-GUESS), S Lienert (LPX), S Zaehle (OCN), V Bastrikov (ORCHIDEE), P McGuire (SDGVM), E Joetzjer (ISBA-CTRIP) and E Kato (VISIT) for contributing model outputs.

Of this reason airtightness estimation is of interest. Over the past 30 years researchers have worked on airtightness estimation. This article is divided into two parts. The 1st part deals with earlier work on airtightness estimation. It is seen that there are relatively few references in the literature that deal with estimation of airtightness. None of the reviewed references argue that airtightness measurements can be replaced by estimates. The only reference that deals with airtightness estimation of wood-frame houses with high airtightness did not manage to find a correlation between the estimated and the measured airtightness. For a contractor what really matters is not an estimate of the airtightness of the finished building, but a reliable means to be sure of reaching the airtightness requirement. It is therefore customary to perform blower-door tests stepwise during the construction process. First the airtightness of the building with the wind-barrier is measured, n(50w). Then the airtightness of the finished building that also has a vapour barrier is measured, n(50f). The airtightness requirement is set for n(50f). Of various reasons it is not given that n(50f) < n(50w) for a given building, and consequently one should have an idea of what an upper limit of n(50w) should be in order to be confident to reach the n(50f) requirement.

Despite the great interest in outdoor thermal comfort, few studies were conducted in arid climates. This study investigated the seasonal differences of outdoor thermal sensation in Tehran (BWk climate), based on 1008 interviews. Also the relationship between three commonly used thermal comfort indices (including UTCI, PET, and PMV) and interviewees' thermal sensation were studied and neutral temperature and neutral range were identified in different seasons. The surveys were conducted on 79 days, periodically, in the four seasons, using microclimatic monitoring as well as subjective interviews. Two analysis approaches (mean/median, and TSVlinear = 0 methods) were applied to show the seasonal differences in neutral temperature. It was found that neutral temperatures, neutral range, and thermal sensations were significantly different, especially between summer, winter, and the two shoulder seasons. Although the two different analysis approaches resulted in noticeably different neutral temperatures, especially in the winter, revealing the importance of the developing standard analysis techniques. The results also indicated that PMV overestimated the thermal sensation by the factors of 1.6-1.8, while PET and UTCI had stronger correlation with actual sensation votes. At the end, an empirical model was proposed for predicting thermal sensation in Tehran. The outcomes of this study showed that to design a sustainable and appropriate urban space in this climate, priorities should be given to the winter and summer seasons.","[Hadianpour, Mohammad; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad; Bemanian, Mohammadreza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Nasrollahi, Farshad] Berlin Univ Arts, Bldg Serv Engn, Berlin, Germany; [Nasrollahi, Farshad] Fac Isfahan Univ Art, Dept Architecture, Berlin, Germany",Tarbiat Modares University,"Mahdavinejad, M (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",mahdavinejad@modares.ac.ir,"; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/H-8187-2017","Haghshenas, Mohammad/0000-0002-1389-0968; Mahdavinejad, Mohammadjavad/0000-0002-6454-6518",,,,,99,49,49,2,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

However, a comprehensive analysis of droughts, including their evolution, complexity, social implications and people's vulnerability is currently lacking. Hence, there is a pressing need for an overview of drought studies in EA. Here, we present a state-of-the-art review of the causes and impacts of, and resilience to droughts in EA. Studies reveal that droughts tend to be more frequent, longer and more severe in the boreal spring and summer in EA, as the overall precipitation and water storage abruptly decline. A decrease in drought frequency is observed during the boreal autumn season (October-November). As these studies have only been analysed within the context of sparse and short-term regional climate data with very complex spatial and seasonal climate patterns, they are subject to uncertainties. The main causes for the changing pattern of droughts include climate variabilities and anthropogenic effects. Droughts have extensive impacts on human beings, environment, water resources and agriculture. Environmental rehabilitation involving the development of ecosystem services, biodiversity enhancement and soil and water conservation is found to be a suitable strategy to adapt to drought conditions. A better understanding of the causes and impacts of droughts, participatory management and community level actions are essential for building resilience to drought. Strong citizens-government-stakeholder cooperation is also valuable in monitoring and managing drought. The knowledge and insights gained from this review will help the countries in EA to build a drought-resilient society and will form a basis of information for other regions outside of EA.","[Haile, Gebremedhin Gebremeskel; Tang, Qiuhong; Sun, Siao; Huang, Zhongwei; Zhang, Xuejun; Liu, Xingcai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Haile, Gebremedhin Gebremeskel; Tang, Qiuhong; Huang, Zhongwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Haile, Gebremedhin Gebremeskel] Tigray Agr Res Inst, Mekelle, Ethiopia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.",tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Sun, Siao/GMX-1603-2022; Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022; Haile, Gebremedhin Gebremeskel/Y-8506-2019; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021","Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Haile, Gebremedhin Gebremeskel/0000-0003-2807-5330; Haile, Gebremedhin Gebremeskel/0000-0003-1326-717X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41790424, 41730645, 41425002]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060402]; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [131A11KYSB20170113]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)-The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) President's Fellowship Programme",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)-The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) President's Fellowship Programme,"This research was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41790424, 41730645 and 41425002), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20060402), and the International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (131A11KYSB20170113).

In this context increasing pressure is being placed on teachers to essentially 'do more with less' and to perform well, despite the changing conditions. Students, too, are challenged to learn in an environment where they have less time with their teachers. What seems surprising is that all of this is occurring whilst the rhetoric of tertiary institutions is being more closely aligned with contemporary constructivist theories of learning with a focus on producing creative graduates. This pressure is now being keenly felt in creative disciplines where studio models of teaching, which require small classes and substantial contact hours, are seriously under threat. If tertiary institutions genuinely want to produce creative graduates there needs to be more widespread understanding of how creative processes are nurtured and creative minds are fostered. Many experienced teachers in creative disciplines have developed such understanding. Their voices need to be encouraged and supported so that the artistry of their creative pedagogies may be articulated and heard above the cacophony of fiscal complaint. We do not naively suggest that financial issues should be disregarded. We do, however, call for a middle way where sophisticated conversations, about both the quality and viability of creative educational practice, amongst all stakeholders can allow for an authentically creative future to emerge.","[Clarke, Angela; Budge, Kylie] RMIT Univ, Coll Design & Social Context, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Clarke, A (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Coll Design & Social Context, GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",angela.clarke@rmit.edu.au; kylie.budge@rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,34,7,8,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1476-8062,1476-8070,,INT J ART DES EDUC,Int.

Amongst all EBUS, the bias is largest in the southeastern tropical Atlantic (SETA). Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance in the SETA of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), including fine resolution (HighResMIP) and ocean-forced (OMIP) models. We show that biases in the SETA remain large in CMIP6 models but are reduced in HighResMIP, with OMIP models giving the best performance. The analysis suggests that, once local forcing errors have been reduced, the major source of the SETA biases lies in the equatorial Atlantic. This study shows that finer model resolution has helped reduce the local origin of the SETA SST bias but further developments of model physics schemes will be required to make progress.","[Farneti, Riccardo; Ssebandeke, John B.] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, Trieste, Italy; [Stiz, Alessandro] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Fis, Trieste, Italy; [Ssebandeke, John B.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); University of Trieste; Max Planck Society,"Farneti, R (corresponding author), Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys Sect, Trieste, Italy.",rfarneti@ictp.it,,"Ssebandeke, John/0000-0002-5203-1365",Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),"We acknowledge the infrastructure and financial support of The Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).

In particular, positive (negative) phases of IOD tend to be associated with above-normal (below-normal) monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. Realistic simulation of the IOD and Indian summer monsoon connection, however, remains a challenge in many of the state-of-the-art climate models. This study presents an analysis of IOD and its links to the Indian monsoon based on the historical simulations from the IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM) and other models that participated in the 6th phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Our findings indicate that the IITM-ESM provides not only a fairly realistic simulation of the ocean-atmosphere coupled interactions and the Bjerknes feedback processes associated with IOD events but also better captures the summer monsoon precipitation response over the Indian subcontinent during IOD events, as compared to several CMIP6 models. The physical mechanisms contributing to the improved simulation of IOD and its monsoon connection in the IITM-ESM are evaluated in this study.","[Prajeesh, A.

In the context of climate change, long-range weather forecasts also represent key elements for the development of adaptation strategies. In spite of an undeniable potential, long-range forecasts issued for instance by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) have yet to find widespread application in European agriculture. To address partially the question of why this is the case, the performance of the ECMWF monthly ensemble forecasting system was examined. It was noted that predictability is currently limited to about 3 weeks for temperature and 2 weeks for precipitation and solar radiation. This may appear deceptive at first sight, but it was noticed that precipitation forecasts over a month are, overall, at least as valuable as information obtained from observed climatology. Encouraged by this finding, the possibility of using monthly forecasts to predict soil water availability was tested. In an operational context, this could serve as a basis for scheduling irrigation. Positive skills were found for lead times of up to 1 month. It was concluded that more systematic investigations of the possibilities offered by long-range forecasts should be undertaken in the future. However, this will require additional efforts to increase the quality of the forecasts, design appropriate application tools and promote the dissemination of the outcome within the agriculture community.","[Calanca, P.; Bolius, D.] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon, Res Stn ART, Air Pollut & Climate Grp, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Weigel, A.

Model response has been analysed in terms of low level circulation, 2-m temperature, precipitation and cloud cover. Evaluation was conducted with respect to a combination of available ground observations, satellite products and reanalysis. Results reveal a good accuracy of the model in reproducing the circulation and a satisfactory representation of temperature, compared with other state-of-art RCMs, confirming that the albedo and aerosol parameterization schemes adopted lead to a remarkable improvement in model performances. The effects of increasing spatial resolution on the quality of the results have also been investigated.

Yet the extensive animal rock art in the area, presumed to depict real activities in the lives of the painters, suggests that environmental conditions were significantly different when the rock art was produced. Here we report on exploration of the area, which led to the discovery of morphologically-distinct carbonate structures that line the walls of two valleys in Gebel Uweinat, and were likely formed in standing water. The carbonate structures comprise what appear to be shoreline carbonate formations, and date back to 8100 and 9400 years BP. The chemical and morphological similarity of these formations to carbonate structures from modern lakes suggests that these lakes contained fresh, standing water suitable for human and animal use. However, the significant quartz content suggests that windblown sand was pervasive, and thus the vegetation cover may have been sparse. This discovery supports the possibility of grasslands in the area, which may have been able to support human habitation, and adds to the evidence for a wetter climate in the area in the early Holocene.

Here, we developed a state-of-the-art method integrating biological theory with survey and experimental data in a way that allows us to explicitly model both physical tolerance limits of species and inherent natural variability in regional conditions and thereby improve the reliability of species distribution predictions under future climate conditions. By using a macroalga-herbivore association (Fucus vesiculosus - Idotea balthica) as a case study, we illustrated how salinity reduction and temperature increase under future climate conditions may significantly reduce the occurrence and biomass of these important coastal species. Moreover, we showed that the reduction of herbivore occurrence is linked to reduction of their host macroalgae. Spatial predictive modelling and experimental biology have been traditionally seen as separate fields but stronger interlinkages between these disciplines can improve species distribution projections under climate change. Experiments enable qualitative prior knowledge to be defined and identify cause-effect relationships, and thereby better foresee alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning under future climate conditions that are not necessarily seen in projections based on non-causal statistical relationships alone.","[Kotta, Jonne; Janes, Holger; Orav-Kotta, Helen] Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Vanhatalo, Jarno] Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Vanhatalo, Jarno] Univ Helsinki, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Program, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Janes, Holger] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, 221 Burwood Hwy, Melbourne, Vic 3125, Australia; [Rugiu, Luca; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; [Bobsien, Ivo] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Viitasalo, Markku; Virtanen, Elina] Finnish Environm Inst, FIN-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Sandman, Antonia Nystrom; Isaeus, Martin] AquaBiota Water Res, Lojtnantsgatan 25, SE-11550 Stockholm, Sweden; [Leidenberger, Sonja] Univ Skovde, Sch Biosci, Ecol Modelling Grp, SE-54128 Skovde, Sweden; [Jonsson, Per R.; Johannesson, Kerstin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci Tjarno, SE-45296 Tjarno, Stromstad, Sweden",University of Tartu; Estonian Marine Institute; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Deakin University; University of Turku; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Skovde; University of Gothenburg,"Kotta, J (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Estonian Marine Inst, Maealuse 14, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",jonne@sea.ee,"Kotta, Jonne/B-5542-2009; Orav-Kotta, Helen/E-2810-2013; Vanhatalo, Jarno/H-4435-2012; Johannesson, Kerstin/X-7994-2019; Virtanen, Elina/Y-6559-2019; Jormalainen, Veijo/B-2073-2008","Kotta, Jonne/0000-0002-4970-6755; Orav-Kotta, Helen/0000-0002-3029-5642; Vanhatalo, Jarno/0000-0002-6831-0211; Johannesson, Kerstin/0000-0003-0176-7986; Virtanen, Elina/0000-0001-9702-6677; Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585; Nystrom Sandman, Antonia/0000-0002-4511-6176; Viitasalo, Markku/0000-0002-9767-5084","BONUS project BAMBI; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme [Art 185]; European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea countries; Estonian Research Council [IUT02-20]; Academy of Finland [317255]; University of Helsinki; Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; Linnaeus Centre for Marine Evolutionary Biology at the University of Gothenburg; Swedish Research Councils VR and Formas; Ministry of Environment, Finland (VELMU Programme); SmartSea project (Academy of Finland, Strategic Research Council) [292985]","BONUS project BAMBI; joint Baltic Sea research and development programme; European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea countries; Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); University of Helsinki; Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation; Linnaeus Centre for Marine Evolutionary Biology at the University of Gothenburg; Swedish Research Councils VR and Formas; Ministry of Environment, Finland (VELMU Programme); SmartSea project (Academy of Finland, Strategic Research Council)","J.K., H.J., L.R., V.J., H.O.K., S.L., P.R.J. and K.J. were supported by the BONUS project BAMBI, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration and various national research funding agencies of the Baltic Sea countries.

The IGP occupies a total area of approximately 43.7 m ha and represent eight agro-ecological regions (AER) and 14 agro-ecological subregions. The area of the IGP is nearly 13% of the total geographical area of the country, and it produces about 50% of the total foodgrains to feed 40% of the population of the country. Thus the sustainability of the present cropping system and also the health of the soils demand a review on the historical development of the soils and their management that remained associated with the tectonic, climatic and geomorphic history of the IGP since it came into existence due to collision of the Indian and Chinese plates during the Middle Miocene. This review provides a state-of-the-art information on the historical development of soils of the IGP, their tectonic-climate-linked natural degradation during the Holocene, and changes in the levels of carbon in soils under agriculture (mainly rice-wheat cropping system), practised over the years. In view of the vast area of the IGP, research initiatives on benchmark soils are, however, still needed to record the subtilities in pedogenesis, especially their polygenetic history due to climate change during the Holocene. This way a historical soil-climate-crop databank may be established to help in fine-tuning the existing management interventions of the national agricultural research system and also the system-modellers in predicting future projections on the sustainability issue of the rice-wheat cropping system in the IGP.","[Pal, D.

Although the NWPac Ocean has warmed due to human-induced greenhouse forcing since the mid-20th century, the extent to which historical anthropogenic effects increase the occurrence probability of such regionally unprecedented warm temperatures is unclear. In this study, using state-of-the-art climate models, we estimate that the August 2020 record high SST in the NWPac likely occurred once per 12-18 years in 2001-2020 owing to historical anthropogenic forcing, and this record SST unlikely occurred without human influences. In the 20th century, anthropogenic effects on the NWPac SST were not distinguishable from internal variability since warming caused by greenhouse gases was largely canceled by aerosol cooling. Furthermore, the 2020 warm SST is projected to be the new normal by 2031-2050, or even if the 2.0 degrees C goal of the Paris Agreement is achieved. Plain Language Summary Beyond the seasonal warmth of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in boreal summer, the SST in the northwestern Pacific (NWPac; 120 degrees E-180 degrees E, 20 degrees N-35 degrees N) was unprecedentedly high in August 2020. This anomalous condition potentially intensified tropical cyclones, causing severe damage to the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Although human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have gradually warmed the NWPac Ocean since the mid-20th century, it remains unclear how much human activity increases the occurrence likelihood of such regionally unprecedented warm temperatures. Here, we analyzed the observed NWPac August SSTs, as well as those in numerical simulations of state-of-the-art climate models under human-induced and natural solar and volcanic forcings from the 20th century to the present. Our results show that, owing to human-induced warming in the past, the August 2020 record high SST in the NWPac likely occurred once per 12-18 years in 2001-2020 as frequently as we observed. We also analyzed the future projection simulations of the climate models, indicating that the 2020 warm SST in the NWPac is expected to be the new normal climate condition of August by 2031-2050, or even if we achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise well below 2.0 degrees C relative to preindustrial levels.","[Hayashi, Michiya; Shiogama, Hideo; Emori, Seita; Ogura, Tomoo; Hirota, Nagio] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Hayashi, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",hayashi.michiya@nies.go.jp,"Shiogama, Hideo/B-9598-2012; Hayashi, Michiya/Q-6230-2017","Shiogama, Hideo/0000-0001-5476-2148; Hayashi, Michiya/0000-0001-7762-352X; Hirota, Nagio/0000-0002-7400-3365; Emori, Seita/0000-0002-9949-5167; Ogura, Tomoo/0000-0002-8441-0044","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (MEXT, Japan) [JPMXD0717935457]; ERTDF (Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan) [2-1904]; Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of NIES","Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (MEXT, Japan); ERTDF (Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan); Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of NIES","This study was supported by the Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (JPMXD0717935457) (MEXT, Japan), ERTDF 2-1904 (Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan), and the Climate Change Adaptation Research Program of NIES.

To this end, this study employs the state-of-the-art global integrated assessment model MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM to investigate mid-century decarbonization strategies for developing Asia to 2050. Our results indicate that a radical change in the energy portfolio is required to reach the target of 'well below' 2 degrees C. Specifically, our scenarios point to a rapid reduction of fossil fuel utilization, enhancement of low-carbon energy supply, and boosting of energy efficiency efforts. Such a transformation leads to a deep cut in CO2 emissions by 78% and 93% by 2050 in scenarios consistent with the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C targets, respectively. Electricity generation and final energy consumption become dominated by low-carbon energy by 2050 in these scenarios. In terms of investment needs beyond a baseline scenario, the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C pathways imply that the scale of low-carbon investment may need to double and triple, respectively. These increases would be partially offset by disinvestment in coal, oil and natural gas extraction and conversion infrastructure. Decarbonizing the energy system also impacts the capital needed for making progress on other sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as air pollution, clean water and food security. Key policy insights Governments will need to employ a variety of policy mechanisms, including mandates and subsidies for renewables and electric vehicles, efficiency standards for end-use technologies, and bans on free-emitting fossil fuel plants, among others. Relative to the baseline scenario for developing Asia, the scale of investment into low-carbon energy to 2050 may need to double for a 2 degrees C scenario, and to triple for 1.5 degrees C. Policy instruments such as green finance are essential for this region to mobilize a broadened channel of investment, particularly from the private sector. Low-carbon investment would significantly reduce the capital investment needed to achieve the SDG target for air quality, but increase the requirements for meeting targets on clean water and food security, though only to a small extent.","[Zhou, Wenji; McCollum, David L.; Fricko, Oliver; Fujimori, Shinichiro; Gidden, Matthew; Guo, Fei; Hasegawa, Tomoko; Huppmann, Daniel; Krey, Volker; Parkinson, Simon; Riahi, Keywan; Rafaj, Peter; Schoepp, Wolfgang] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Zhou, Wenji] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Mfg & Civil Engn, Teknologivn 22, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway; [McCollum, David L.] Elect Power Res Inst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [McCollum, David L.] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA; [Fujimori, Shinichiro] Kyoto Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kusatsu, Japan; [Huang, Han; Liu, Changyi; Yang, Fang; Zhou, Yuanbing] Global Energy Interconnect Dev & Cooperat Org, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Krey, Volker] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway; [Krey, Volker] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Energy Transit Programme, Trondheim, Norway; [Parkinson, Simon] Univ Victoria, Inst Integrated Energy Syst, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria; [Riahi, Keywan] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Ritsumeikan University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Victoria; Graz University of Technology; Colorado School of Mines,"Zhou, WJ (corresponding author), IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.;Zhou, WJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Mfg & Civil Engn, Teknologivn 22, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway.",wenji.zhou@ntnu.no,"Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Fricko, Oliver/ABE-5732-2020; Riahi, Keywan/B-6426-2011","Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; Fricko, Oliver/0000-0002-6835-9883; Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515; Zhou, Wenji/0000-0001-8355-8357; Rafaj, Peter/0000-0003-1000-5617; McCollum, David/0000-0003-1293-0179; Riahi, Keywan/0000-0001-7193-3498; Guo, Fei/0000-0001-6415-8083; Huppmann, Daniel/0000-0002-7729-7389","Global Energy Interconnection Group Corporation project [52450018000Q]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan [2-1908]; China's National R&D Program, China [2016YFA0602602]; World Bank; IIASA","Global Energy Interconnection Group Corporation project; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan; China's National R&D Program, China; World Bank(The World Bank India); IIASA","This study was funded by the Global Energy Interconnection Group Corporation project (No. 52450018000Q), the World Bank, the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1908) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan, China's National R&D Program (2016YFA0602602), China and Peter Kolp of IIASA is also recognized for his assistance with Web database development and support.",,50,9,9,2,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Drawing from the traditional Chinese popular literature of chuanqi, crime thrillers, martial arts films, and horror films, the film was a smash hit with domestic audiences despite condemnation for its poor taste by many critics. The significance of Mysterious Buddha lies not only in its pioneering efforts in reviving the martial arts film genre in the PRC, which is the primary focus of previous studies, but-more importantly-in its ability to reflect the containment of popular cinema and the subsequent ascension of elite film culture. An unmistakable commercial other, the film represents a conspicuous departure from Socialist orthodox with its emphasis on plot over characters, native cultural relics over modernization, and bodily confrontation over intellectual engagement. The film was publicly denounced by many influential public figures but was eventually authorized for release. Its haphazard treatment indicated the emergence of a new film bureaucracy, professional institutions, and power balance while a new cinematic direction was sought in the changed political and cultural climate. This chapter reappraises the 1980s' popular cinema represented by Mysterious Buddha and provides a case study to demonstrate the contested nature of nascent Chinese popular culture in the early 1980s.","[Yang, Li] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Asian Studies, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Yang, L (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Asian Studies, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",yangli@utexas.edu,,,,,,,33,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1464-9373,1469-8447,,INTER-ASIA CULT STUD,Inter-Asia Cult.

It provides a statistically well-defined pattern to study the predictability of the European winter climate. In this paper, the predictability of the NAO and the associated surface temperature variations are considered using a dynamical prediction approach. Two state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean ensemble forecast systems are used, namely the seasonal forecast system 2 from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the multi-model system developed within the joint European project DEMETER (Development of a European Multi-Model Ensemble Prediction System for Seasonal to Inter-annual Prediction). The predictability is defined in probabilistic space using the debiased ranked probability skill score with adapted discretization (RPSSD). The potential predictability of the NAO and its impact are also investigated in a perfect model approach, where each ensemble member is used once as observation''. This approach assumes that the climate system is fully represented by the model physics. Using the perfect model approach for the period 1959-2001, it is shown that the mean winter NAO index is potentially predictable with a lead time of 1 month (i.e. from 1st of November). The prediction benefit is rather small (6% skill relative to a reference climatology) but statistically significant. A similar conclusion holds for the near surface temperature variability related to the NAO. Again, the potential benefit is small (5%) but statistically significant. Using the forecast approach, the NAO skill is not statistically significant for the period 1959-2001, while for the period 1987-2001 the skill is surprisingly large (15% relative to a climate prediction). Furthermore, a weak relation is found between the strength of the NAO amplitude and the skill of the NAO. This contrasts with El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, where the forecast skill is strongly amplitude dependent. In general, robust results are only achieved if the sensitivity with respect to the sample size (both the ensemble size and length of the period) is correctly taken into account.","Swiss Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland; Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",Federal Office of Meteorology & Climatology (MeteoSwiss),"Muller, WA (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008; Appenzeller, Christof/AAA-8989-2022; Appenzeller, Christof/B-3015-2013","Schar, Christoph/0000-0002-4171-1613; Appenzeller, Christof/0000-0002-9939-9845; Appenzeller, Christof/0000-0002-9939-9845",,,,,34,47,48,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

In order to manage the impact on the climate, a better understanding of the variability of global warming potential in agriculture is needed. This study assesses the variability in global warming potential of 27 crops using the modular extrapolation of agricultural life cycle assessment (MEXALCA) method, a modular, geographical extrapolation method for crop life cycle assessment. The global warming potential results, excluding land use change, were validated with crop data from the ecoinvent database and from the literature. The production weighted worldwide mean values of global warming potential for the 27 crops varied in a wide range (factor of 20 in impact per ha; factor of 100 in impact per kg). The global warming potential values per kg of fresh mass were lowest for sugar crops (<0.05 kg CO2-eq kg(-1)), followed by root crops (<0.15 kg CO2-eq kg(-1)), vegetables and fruits (<0.35 kg CO2-eq kg(-1)), and oil palm. Cereals (except rice), pulses, rapeseed and soybean had medium values (<0.6 kg CO2-eq kg(-1)). Highest values were found for treenuts, other oil crops (linseed, cotton, peanuts), and rice (1.2-2.4 kg CO2-eq kg(-1)). The global warming potential per kg fresh mass was negatively correlated with the mean yield of the different crops, but not in the case of the same crop produced in different countries. The farming intensity in different countries, the yields and the selection of producing countries were important contributory factors in determining the variability of global warming potential.

Discrepancies remain, however, in the estimated magnitude and persistence of the surface temperature cooling caused by volcanic eruptions, as characterized by paleoclimatic proxies and climate models. We investigate these discrepancies in the context of large tropical eruptions over the Last Millennium using two state-of-the-art data assimilation products, the Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA) and the Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR), and simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model-Last Millennium Ensemble (NCAR CESM-LME). We find that PHYDA and LMR estimate mean global and hemispheric cooling that is similar in magnitude and persistence once effects from eruptions occurring in short succession are removed. The estimates also compare well to Northern-Hemisphere reconstructions based solely or partially on tree-ring density, which have been proposed as the most accurate proxy estimates of surface cooling due to volcanism. All proxy-based estimates also agree well with the magnitude of the mean cooling simulated by the CESM-LME. Differences remain, however, in the spatial patterns of the temperature responses in the PHYDA, LMR, and the CESM-LME. The duration of cooling anomalies also persists for several years longer in the PHYDA and LMR relative to the CESM-LME. Our results demonstrate progress in resolving discrepancies between proxy- and model-based estimates of temperature responses to volcanism, but also indicate these estimates must be further reconciled to better characterize the risks of future volcanic eruptions.","[Tejedor, E.; Vuille, M.] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Steiger, N.; Smerdon, J.

Most previous simulations have prescribed a particular strategy and evaluated its modeled effects. Here we turn this approach around by first choosing example climate objectives and then designing a strategy to meet those objectives in climate models. There are four essential criteria for designing a strategy: (i) an explicit specification of the objectives, (ii) defining what climate forcing agents to modify so the objectives are met, (iii) a method for managing uncertainties, and (iv) independent verification of the strategy in an evaluation model. We demonstrate this design perspective through two multi-objective examples. First, changes in Arctic temperature and the position of tropical precipitation due to CO2 increases are offset by adjusting high-latitude insolation in each hemisphere independently. Second, three different latitude-dependent patterns of insolation are modified to offset CO2-induced changes in global mean temperature, interhemispheric temperature asymmetry, and the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient. In both examples, the 'design' and 'evaluation' models are state-of-the-art fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.","[Kravitz, Ben; Wang, Hailong; Rasch, Philip J.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [MacMartin, Douglas G.] CALTECH, Dept Comp & Math Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [MacMartin, Douglas G.] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; Cornell University,"Kravitz, B (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA.",ben.kravitz@pnnl.gov,"MacMartin, Douglas G/A-6333-2016; Kravitz, Ben/P-7925-2014; Wang, Hailong/B-8061-2010; MacMartin, Douglas/AAB-5314-2020; Wang, Hailong/AAM-1464-2021; Rasch, Philip J/F-7978-2018","MacMartin, Douglas G/0000-0003-1987-9417; Kravitz, Ben/0000-0001-6318-1150; Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-1994-4402; Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-1994-4402; Rasch, Philip J/0000-0002-5125-2174",NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center; US Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute [DE-AC05-76RL01830],NASA High-End Computing (HEC) Program through the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center; US Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),We thank the reviewers and the editor for thorough comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

During drought plants respond physiologically and structurally to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. This has consequences for carbon uptake by photosynthesis and release by total ecosystem respiration. After a drought the disturbances in the reservoirs of moisture, organic matter and nutrients in the soil and carbohydrates in plants lead to longer-term effects in plant carbon cycling, and potentially mortality. Direct and carry-over effects, mortality and consequently species competition in response to drought are strongly related to the survival strategies of species. Here we review the state of the art of the understanding of the relation between soil moisture drought and the interactions with the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems. We argue that plant strategies must be given an adequate role in global vegetation models if the effects of drought on the carbon cycle are to be described in a way that justifies the interacting processes.

However, it is unclear whether farmers realize these benefits when crop choices available to farmers have different and variable costs and returns; multiple countries have programs that incentivize production of certain crops while other crops are subject to market fluctuations. We hypothesize that the benefits of forecasts on farmer livelihoods will be moderated by the combined impact of differing crop economics and changing climate. Drawing upon methods and insights from both physical and social sciences, we develop a model of farmer decision-making to evaluate this hypothesis. The model dynamics are explored using empirical data from Sri Lanka; primary sources include survey and interview information as well as game-based experiments conducted with farmers in the field. Our simulations show that a farmer using seasonal forecasts has more diversified crop selections, which drive increases in average agricultural income. Increases in income are particularly notable under a drier climate scenario, when a farmer using seasonal forecasts is more likely to plant onions, a crop with higher possible returns. Our results indicate that, when water resources are scarce (i.e. drier climate scenario), farmer incomes could become stratified, potentially compounding existing disparities in farmers' financial and technical abilities to use forecasts to inform their crop selections. This analysis highlights that while programs that promote production of certain crops may ensure food security in the short-term, the long-term implications of these dynamics need careful evaluation.","[Gunda, T.; Bazuin, J.

Several state-of-the-art ice flow models are currently being employed on various grid resolutions to estimate future mass changes in the framework of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (IS-MIP6). Here we investigate the sensitivity to grid resolution of centennial sea-level contributions from the Greenland ice sheet and study the mechanism at play. We employ the finiteelement higher-order Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) and conduct experiments with four different horizontal resolutions, namely 4, 2, 1 and 0.75 km. We run the simulation based on the ISMIP6 core climate forcing from the MIROC5 global circulation model (GCM) under the high-emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and consider both atmospheric and oceanic forcing in full and separate scenarios. Under the full scenarios, finer simulations unveil up to approximately 5% more sea-level rise compared to the coarser resolution. The sensitivity depends on the magnitude of outlet glacier retreat, which is implemented as a series of retreat masks following the ISMIP6 protocol. Without imposed retreat under atmosphereonly forcing, the resolution dependency exhibits an opposite behaviour with approximately 5% more sea-level contribution in the coarser resolution. The sea-level contribution indicates a converging behaviour below a 1 km horizontal resolution. A driving mechanism for differences is the ability to resolve the bedrock topography, which highly controls ice discharge to the ocean. Additionally, thinning and acceleration emerge to propagate further inland in high resolution for many glaciers. A major response mechanism is sliding, with an enhanced feedback on the effective normal pressure at higher resolution leading to a larger increase in sliding speeds under scenarios with outlet glacier retreat.","[Rueckamp, Martin; Humbert, Angelika] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Goelzer, Heiko] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res IMAU, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Goelzer, Heiko] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Glaciol, Brussels, Belgium; [Goelzer, Heiko] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Humbert, Angelika] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, Bremen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Utrecht University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); University of Bremen","Ruckamp, M (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Bremerhaven, Germany.",martin.rueckamp@awi.de,"Goelzer, Heiko/M-2367-2016","Goelzer, Heiko/0000-0002-5878-9599; Ruckamp, Martin/0000-0003-2512-7238; Humbert, Angelika/0000-0002-0244-8760","Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (regional climate change); programme of the Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC) - Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) [024.002.001]","Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (regional climate change); programme of the Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC) - Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)","Martin Ruckamp has been supported by the Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM (regional climate change).

In recent decades, developments in ground and satellite measurements have made the hydrometeorological information readily available, and advances in information technology have facilitated the data analysis in a real-time manner. New progress in climate research and modeling has enabled the prediction of seasonal climate with reasonable accuracy and increased resolution. These emerging techniques and advances have enabled more timely acquisition of accurate hydrological fluxes and status, and earlier warning of extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods. This paper gives current state-of-the-art understanding of the uncertainties in hydrological monitoring and forecasting, reviews the efforts and progress in operational hydrological monitoring system assisted by observations from various sources and experimental seasonal hydrological forecasting, and briefly introduces the current monitoring and forecasting practices in China. The grand challenges and perspectives for the near future are also discussed, including acquiring and extracting reliable information for monitoring and forecasting, predicting realistic hydrological fluxes and states in the river basin being significantly altered by human activity, and filling the gap between numerical models and the end user. We highlight the importance of understanding the needs of the operational water management and the priority to transfer research knowledge to decision-makers.","[Tang Qiuhong; Zhang Xuejun; Li Zhe; Liu Xingcai] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Duan Qingyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Huang Shifeng] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Remote Sensing Technol Applicat Ctr, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Yuan Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, RCE TEA, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Cui Huijuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang Xuejun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Beijing Normal University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Duan, Qingyun/C-7652-2011; Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021; Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018","Duan, Qingyun/0000-0001-9955-1512; Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Cui, Huijuan/0000-0002-0308-1550",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41425002]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB955403]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (Major projects) [GYHY201506001-7]; Beijing Science and Technology Plan Project [Z141100003614052],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (Major projects); Beijing Science and Technology Plan Project,"Foundation: National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 41425002; National Basic Research Program of China, No. 2012CB955403; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (Major projects), No. GYHY201506001-7; The Beijing Science and Technology Plan Project, No. Z141100003614052",,137,16,16,10,93,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

However, the complexity of tree crown morphology that is typically formed after many years of growth tends to render it a non-trivial task, even for the state-of-the-art 3D forest mapping technology-light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Fortunately, botanists have deduced the large structural diversity of tree forms into only a limited number of tree architecture models, which can present a-priori knowledge about tree structure, growth, and other attributes for different species. This study attempted to recruit Halle architecture models (HAMs) into LiDAR mapping to investigate tree growth habits in structure. First, following the HAM-characterized tree structure organization rules, we run the kernel procedure of tree species classification based on the LiDAR-collected point clouds using a support vector machine classifier in the leave-one-out-for-cross-validation mode. Then, the HAM corresponding to each of the classified tree species was identified based on expert knowledge, assisted by the comparison of the LiDAR-derived feature parameters. Next, the tree growth habits in structure for each of the tree species were derived from the determined HAM. In the case of four tree species growing in the boreal environment, the tests indicated that the classification accuracy reached 85.0%, and their growth habits could be derived by qualitative and quantitative means. Overall, the strategy of recruiting conventional HAMs into LiDAR mapping for investigating tree growth habits in structure was validated, thereby paving a new way for efficiently reflecting tree growth habits and projecting forest structure dynamics.","[Lin, Yi] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing Key Lab Spatial Informat Integrat & Its A, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Miao] China Met Geol Bur, Inst Mineral Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pellikka, Petri; Heiskanen, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland",Peking University; University of Helsinki,"Lin, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing Key Lab Spatial Informat Integrat & Its A, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yi.lin@pku.edu.cn,"Lin, Yi/I-1565-2014; Heiskanen, Janne/K-4668-2019","Heiskanen, Janne/0000-0002-3899-8860","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670718, 41471281, 41401515]; SRF, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); SRF, China","This work was financially supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31670718, 41471281, and 41401515) and in part by the SRF for ROCS, SEM, China.",,49,5,5,3,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Reanalysis data have been widely applied to obtain surface radiation components. Since new generation reanalysis data have been released, a comprehensive evaluation of the L-d predictions from the latest reanalysis data using ground measurements is still necessary. In this study, the L-d estimates of four representative reanalysis data (CFSR, JRA-55, ERA5, and MERRA2) were evaluated using ground observations at 383 stations from the AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, BSRN, Buoy, FLUXNET, and SURFEAD networks. The evaluation results manifested that the overall root mean square errors (mean bias errors) of daily mean L-d values over the global surface were 21.1 (- 1.8) W m(-2), 22.4 (- 3.9) W m(-2), 19.3 (- 3.6) W m(-2), 25.2 (- 12.6) W m(-2), and 20.5 (3.1) W m(-2) for CFSR, JRA-55, ERA5, MERAA2, and CERES-SYN, respectively. Compared with the CERES-SYN satellite retrievals, the ERA5 (CFSR) daily mean L-d estimates had relatively smaller overall root mean square errors (mean bias errors) over the global land surface. Over the global ocean surface, the JRA-55 daily mean L-d estimates had comparable mean bias errors (MBEs) with CERES-SYN.

This work leverages integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to conduct inference under a Bayesian hierarchical model using data from three sources: a state-of-the-art proxy database (PAGES 2k), surface temperature observations (HadCRUT4), and latest estimates of external forcings. INLA's computational efficiency allows to explore several model formulations (with or without forcings, explicitly modeling internal variability or not), as well as five data reduction techniques. Two different validation exercises find a small impact of data reduction choices, but a large impact for model choice, with best results for the two models that incorporate external forcings. These models confirm that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the largest contributor to temperature variability over the Common Era, followed by volcanic forcing. Solar effects are indistinguishable from zero. INLA provide an efficient way to estimate the posterior mean, comparable with the much costlier Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedure, but with wider uncertainty bounds. We recommend using it for exploration of model designs, but full MCMC solutions should be used for proper uncertainty quantification.

Whilst the European Union (EU) Clean Energy Package has established a more coherent and comprehensive regime for RES support schemes in general, it makes no explicit reference to net metering schemes. This raises questions as to how and under which terms net metering schemes are compatible with EU law. Against this background, this article aims to analyse the relevant EU law provisions and conduct a comparative analysis of net metering regimes in four Member States to demonstrate that the national schemes enacted and applied have significantly different design features.

Although STRBs are widely used as a low-cost and sustainable nature-based solution for domestic sludge dewatering, the number of applications for industrial sludge treatment is very limited. This study presents the few available pilot and full-scale STRB systems from various countries that receive and treat sludge from industrial wastewater treatment plants or sludge from Water Works. The overall efficiency and performance for this particular application is also discussed along with the advantages of this green technology. Finally, this study proposes the optimum design parameters for proper dimensioning and operation of STRBs for industrial sludge dewatering. Sludge treatment reed beds (STRBs) are an established sludge treatment technology with multiple environmental and economic advantages in dewatering sludge generated during domestic wastewater treatment. However, little is reported regarding their appropriateness and efficiency for the treatment of sludge produced during industrial wastewater treatment and from water works. These sludge types may have significantly different quality characteristics than typical domestic sludge and may contain constituents that could affect their dewaterability. Therefore, the dewatering of these industrial sludge types is usually tested in small-scale pilot STRBs before the construction of full-scale systems. This paper presents and summarizes the state-of-the-art experience from existing pilot and full-scale STRB systems from various countries and climates treating sludge from various industrial sources, evaluates the suitability and the advantages of this sustainable treatment technology, and proposes the required dimensioning for efficient full-scale STRB operation and performance.","[Nielsen, Steen] Orbicon WSP, Linnes Alle 2, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark; [Stefanakis, Alexandros, I] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Stefanakis, AI (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece.",Steen.Nielsen@wsp.com; astefanakis@enveng.tuc.gr,"Stefanakis, Alexandros I./H-6523-2019","Stefanakis, Alexandros I./0000-0001-8124-1428",General Secretariat of Research and Technology (GSRT) of Greece; Operational Program of the Region of East Macedonia-Thrace,General Secretariat of Research and Technology (GSRT) of Greece(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); Operational Program of the Region of East Macedonia-Thrace,"The research study in Greece was funded by the General Secretariat of Research and Technology (GSRT) of Greece, as part of the project Integrated Management of Sludge from Wastewater Treatment Facilities, andWastewater Treatment Using Natural Systems, Operational Program of the Region of East Macedonia-Thrace.",,64,5,5,10,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979-2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.","[Rantanen, Mika; Karpechko, Alexey Yu; Nordling, Kalle; Hyvarinen, Otto; Ruosteenoja, Kimmo; Vihma, Timo; Laaksonen, Ari] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Lipponen, Antti] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Kuopio, Finland; [Nordling, Kalle] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, Oslo, Norway; [Laaksonen, Ari] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Appl Phys, Kuopio, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute; Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Eastern Finland,"Rantanen, M (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland.",mika.rantanen@fmi.fi,"Lipponen, Antti/AAL-1445-2021; Rantanen, Mika/AAV-2299-2021","Lipponen, Antti/0000-0002-6902-9974; Rantanen, Mika/0000-0003-4279-0322","ACCC Flagship - Academy of Finland [337552]; Academy of Finland [317999, 342890]; European Commission [101003590]",ACCC Flagship - Academy of Finland; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"This research has been supported by the ACCC Flagship funded by the Academy of Finland (decision no 337552).

Perturbed physics ensembles represent a promising tool to delimit the range of model uncertainty in a probabilistic sense. Yet large ensembles with complex climate models are still constrained by available computer resources. Here, an extended energy balance model with a stochastic weather term, feedback, and natural and anthropogenic forcings is used to investigate the potential of large perturbed physics ensembles. Up to 100,000 simulations for the 20th and 21st centuries are realized, assembling appropriate random numbers for 9 different model parameters. Bayesian model averaging is applied to filter the simulations in the face of observed temperatures and measurement error. The resulting ensemble mean has learned noticeably from the data and is very close to the observed time series of global-mean temperature. It differs markedly from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model ensemble means, especially in terms of more realistic decadal temperature variations due to the learning effect by means of the Bayesian approach. The sensitivity of the model and the Bayesian filter is assessed with respect to the model design and the estimated observational error, respectively.","[Paeth, Heiko] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Paeth, H (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",heiko.paeth@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,63,5,5,0,5,"UNIV BONN, GEOGRAPHISCHES INST",BONN,"MECKENHEIMER ALLEE 166, BONN, GERMANY",0014-0015,,,ERDKUNDE,Erdkunde,JUL-SEP,2015,3,,,,201,216,,10.3112/erdkunde.2015.03.01,http://dx.doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.2015.03.01,,,16,"Geography; Geography, Physical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Physical Geography,CX4QC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000365684400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The best documented examples of rapid climate change in the past are the warming events associated with the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles during the last glacial period, which were sufficiently large to have had a potential feedback through changes in albedo and greenhouse gas emissions on climate. Previous reconstructions of vegetation and fire changes during the D-O cycles used independently constructed age models, making it difficult to compare the changes between different sites and regions. Here, we present the ACER (Abrupt Climate Changes and Environmental Responses) global database, which includes 93 pollen records from the last glacial period (73-15 ka) with a temporal resolution better than 1000 years, 32 of which also provide charcoal records. A harmonized and consistent chronology based on radiometric dating (C-14, U-234/Th-230, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), 40Ar/39Ar-dated tephra layers) has been constructed for 86 of these records, although in some cases additional information was derived using common control points based on event stratigraphy.

Increases in air temperature causes heat stress to the plants, resulting in physiological damage. This work studied the application of processed kaolinite-based particle films (PKPF) as part of environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. This innovative technology aims to increase the productivity of coffee grown in full sunlight and evaluate the interest of coffee growers in incorporating this input in the management of crops as an alternative to the traditional model of increasing production through the expansion of cultivated areas. This is a review of the state of the art of the use of PKPF in coffee, and a descriptive and exploratory research, supported by a literature review and field data collected, through a structured questionnaire applied to a group of coffee producers from the Cerrado in Minas Gerais. The concept of environmentally sustainable coffee production is latent among coffee growers, who adopt practical actions to respect and preserve the environment during the production process. Increases in productivity are related to the adoption of technological innovations such as the use of PKPF in the management of plantations, being a viable alternative to increasing the plantation areas, and thus reducing native vegetation.","[Roda, Newton de Matos; Branchi, Bruna Angela; Longo, Regina Marcia; Pontin, Joao] Pontifical Catholic Univ Campinas, Ctr Econ & Adm, Campus 1,Euryclides de Jesus Zerbini St 1516, BR-13087571 Campinas, Brazil; [de Abreu, Deivisson Pelegrino; dos Santos, Paulo Ricardo; Campostrini, Eliemar] Northern Rio de Janeiro State Univ, Ctr Agr Sci & Technol, Plant Physiol Sect, Av Alberto Lamego 2000, BR-28013602 Campos Dos Goytacazes, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Campinas,"Roda, ND (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Campinas, Ctr Econ & Adm, Campus 1,Euryclides de Jesus Zerbini St 1516, BR-13087571 Campinas, Brazil.;dos Santos, PR (corresponding author), Northern Rio de Janeiro State Univ, Ctr Agr Sci & Technol, Plant Physiol Sect, Av Alberto Lamego 2000, BR-28013602 Campos Dos Goytacazes, Brazil.",newton.roda@tkinet.com; bruna.branchi@puc-campinas.edu.br; regina.longo@puc-campinas.edu.br; jcpontin@gmail.com; deivissonpabreu.uenf@gmail.com; prs_ufal@hotmail.com; campostenator@gmail.com,"Branchi, Bruna A/V-9978-2018; Branchi, Bruna/AAZ-9674-2020; Campostrini, Eliemar/C-4917-2013","Branchi, Bruna A/0000-0001-5312-286X; Branchi, Bruna/0000-0001-5312-286X; Campostrini, Eliemar/0000-0002-1329-1084","TKI/ NovaSource; CNPq [PQ 303166/2019-3]; Fundacao Carlos Chagas de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/202.759/2018, E-26/210.309/2018, E-26/210.037/2020, E-26/204.220/2021]; Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas",TKI/ NovaSource; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao Carlos Chagas de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas,"This research received funding by TKI/ NovaSource.

We conclude that these models execute about 100-250 times too slow for operational throughput rates at a horizontal resolution of 1 km, even when executed on a full petascale system with nearly 5000 state-of-the-art hybrid GPU-CPU nodes.

This walking-writing methodology has connected us to entangled feelings and lived experiences, including our embodied relationships with the ocean, our work in academia, and our rising levels of anxiety as climate change and related environmental crises coincide with our re-membering of oceans, bodies, rhythms and breath. To illustrate our re-membering, we intersperse fragments from our creative writing with reflective discussion. The social, environmental and political chaos surrounding us seeps into our processes, highlighting how neoliberal ideologies influence our inability to dis/connect, harming both human and beyond-human life.

Although it has been argued that providing a view outside-or even using daylight instead of more stable and manageable artificial light-could reduce students' performance without providing a pleasant and healthy environment, nowadays it seems that a large consensus upon the need to design well daylit spaces is being reached. This paper reviews how the research community has tackled the task of understanding and solving the complex relationships amongst local climate, users' needs and design constraints in school buildings by showing the different approaches used and technological solutions suggested.

These questions not only concern the damages inflicted by the present Covid-19 pandemic but also those developed by the neoliberal economics and politics of the past forty years and more. In Sellars's view, neoliberalism has been the hotbed of social injustices, inequities, market and other forms of current enslavement, migrations, refugee and related precarities, and the havoc of the world climate in which the plight of humanity and that of the planet are indelibly interconnected. His and Shevtsova's discussion links such vital concerns with his theatre practice, which ranges from his engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples - he details some of his work with the collective, community organization of two Los Angeles Festivals of the early 1990s - to the various forms of his music theatre in which he collaborates, in institutional structures, with highly proficient musicians, singers and dancers. The focus chosen here from his music theatre is The Indian Queen (2013), which Sellars dramaturgically invents using pieces by Henry Purcell combined with prose fragments by Nicaraguan novelist Rosario Aguilar. Peter Sellars is an internationally renowned theatre director among whose more recent productions is Mozart's Idomeneo, premiered at the Salzburg Festival in 2019. Maria Shevtsova, Professor of Drama and Theatre Arts at Goldsmiths, University of London, is editor of New Theatre Quarterly.

Recent studies characterizing the effects of climate change on air quality and the broader distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere show significant, but inconsistent results, including the sign of the effect(1-3). Using a suite of state-of-the-art climate models, we show that climate change is associated with a negative aerosol-climate feedback of -0.02 to -0.09 W m(-2) K-1 for direct radiative effects, with much larger values likely for indirect radiative effects. This is related to an increase in most aerosol species, particularly over the tropics and Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, largely due to a decrease in wet deposition associated with less large-scale precipitation over land. Although simulation of aerosol processes in global climate models possesses uncertainty, we conclude that climate change may increase aerosol burden and surface concentration, which may have implications for future air quality.","[Allen, Robert J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Landuyt, William] ExxonMobil Res & Engn Co, Corp Strateg Res, Annandale, NJ 08801 USA; [Rumbold, Steven T.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Exxon Mobil Corporation; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Allen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rjallen@ucr.edu,,"Rumbold, Steven/0000-0001-8138-4541; Allen, Robert/0000-0003-1616-9719",,,,,24,67,68,7,93,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

It reflects the hydrological consequences caused by topographic, land cover, and climatic factors, and is an important tool to characterize and predict the hydrological responses to climate and landscape change. In the Loess Plateau region, a large number of reservoirs have been constructed to trap sediment and storage water for drinking, irrigation, and industries. The land cover has been significantly reshaped in the past decades. These changes may alter the watershed hydrological connectivity. In this study, we mapped the spatial pattern of hydrological connectivity with consideration of reservoir impedances, mitigation of climate, and land cover in the Yan River watershed on the Loess Plateau by using the network index (NI) approach that is based on topographical wetness index. Three wetness indices were used, i.e., topographical wetness index (TWI), SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) wetness index (WIS), and wetness index adopted aridity index (AI) determined by precipitation and evapotranspiration (WIPE). In addition, the effective catchment area (ECA) was also employed to reveal the connectivity of reservoirs and river networks to water source areas. Results show thatECAof reservoirs and rivers account for 35% and 65%, respectively; the hydrological connectivity to the reservoir was lower than that to the river networks. The normalized hydrological connectivity revealed that the connectivity to river channels maintained the same distribution pattern but with a decreased range after construction of reservoirs. As revealed by comparing the spatial patterns of hydrological connectivity quantified byNIbased onWI(S)andWI(PE)respectively, vegetation cover patterns had significantly alternated watershed hydrological connectivity. These results imply a decreased volume of flow in river channels after reservoir construction, but with same temporal period of flow dynamic. It is illustrated that the network index (NI) is suitable to quantify the hydrological connectivity and it is dynamic in the context of human intervention and climate change.","[Zhao, Liang; Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Hunan Univ Art & Sci, Hunan Prov Cooperat Innovat Ctr Construct & Dev D, Changde 415000, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yong] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hunan University of Arts & Science; Chengdu University of Technology","Liu, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Art & Sci, Hunan Prov Cooperat Innovat Ctr Construct & Dev D, Changde 415000, Peoples R China.",zhaoliangcdut@163.com; liuyu@igsnrr.ac.cn; luoy@cdut.edu.cn,,"Liu, Yu/0000-0002-1692-1811",National Science Foundation of China [4167011589]; International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [121311KYSB20170004],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This research was funded by the National Science Foundation of China, grant number 4167011589, and the International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, grant number 121311KYSB20170004).",,58,7,7,14,55,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2020,6,,,,,,1742,10.3390/w12061742,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061742,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MT1UO,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000554753400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The papers illustrate how expertise from disciplines as diverse as law, economics, social sciences, the arts, education, zoology, botany, genetics, climate modelling, agriculture, spatial sciences and fire ecology are necessary to address the complex social, ecological and financial questions that underpin restoration ecology. We highlight the complexity of the task, the multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach needed, the importance of science to inform restoration practice and the problem of achieving functional connectivity. We also outline steps that need to be taken in the next 10 years. Together, the outcomes and recommendations from these studies provide a template for restoration in similar highly cleared and degraded agricultural landscapes affected by climate change in Australia and internationally.","[Harrison, Peter A.; Davidson, Neil J.; Bailey, Tanya G.; Jones, Menna; Bowman, David M.

These changes are integrated into the tissues of apex predators over space and time and can be quantified using stable isotopes in the inert feathers of historical and contemporary avian specimens. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) from Western and South Australia from 1936-2011. The Flesh-footed Shearwaters more than doubled their trophic niche (from 3.91 +/- 1.37 parts per thousand(2) to 10.00 +/- 1.79 parts per thousand(2)), and dropped an entire trophic level in 75 years (predicted delta N-15 decreased from +16.9 parts per thousand to + 13.5 parts per thousand, and d 13 C from -16.9 parts per thousand to -17.9 parts per thousand) - the largest change in delta N-15 yet reported in any marine bird, suggesting a relatively rapid shift in the composition of the Indian Ocean food web, or changes in baseline delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. A stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation results in a weaker Leeuwin Current in Western Australia, and decreased Flesh-footed Shearwater delta C-13 and delta N-15. Current climate forecasts predict this trend to continue, leading to increased oceanic 'tropicalization' and potentially competition between Flesh-footed Shearwaters and more tropical sympatric species with expanding ranges. Flesh-footed Shearwater populations are declining, and current conservation measures aimed primarily at bycatch mitigation are not restoring populations. Widespread shifts in foraging, as shown here, may explain some of the reported decline. An improved understanding and ability to mitigate the impacts of global climactic changes is therefore critical to the long-term sustainability of this declining species.","[Bond, Alexander L.] Environm Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Bond, Alexander L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Lavers, Jennifer L.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Lavers, Jennifer L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Environment & Climate Change Canada; University of Saskatchewan; University of Tasmania; Monash University,"Bond, AL (corresponding author), Environm Canada, 11 Innovat Blvd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada.",alex.bond@usask.ca,"Lavers, Jennifer/O-4831-2017","Lavers, Jennifer/0000-0001-7596-6588; Bond, Alexander/0000-0003-2125-7238",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Environment Canada; W.V.

The main mosaic conservation problems, induced by external factors, are related to temperature and humidity variations, which may result in moisture, salt crystallization and accelerated material deterioration within the underlying layers. Though such deterioration in the subsurface is not immediately visible, it can strongly affect the preservation of the entire structure and the decoration layer in the short or long-term future. In this paper, we present and discuss laboratory experimental results of Digital Holographic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DHSPI), applied to the subsurface diagnostic of a mosaic model after artificially induced thermal change and under simulated environmental conditions in climate chamber. The tests were performed on a custom-built wall mosaic model with known construction and known defects, which are simulating voids, detachments and deteriorated, restored or reshuffled areas. Two types of induced stress were used: 1) low thermal excitation emitted by IR lamps directly to the surface; 2) simulated environmental conditions inside the climate chamber. In regards of the in-situ diagnostic investigation any structural alteration occurs as a natural reaction to the surrounding environment and monitoring of surface reactions and defect detection under natural fluctuations it could be considered as a very important aspect of implementation to optimize range of applicability for non-destructive remote portable instrumentation. The obtained DHSPI results on the detection of known defects in the mosaic under artificially induced thermal alteration and under simulated environmental conditions are compared and discussed.","[Chaban, Antonina; Tornari, Vivi; Andrianakis, Michalis] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, Iraklion, Greece; [Chaban, Antonina; Deiana, Rita] Univ Padua, Dept Cultural Heritage Archaeol & Hist Art Cinema, Piazza Capitaniato 7, I-35139 Padua, Italy",Foundation for Research & Technology - Hellas (FORTH); University of Padua,"Tornari, V (corresponding author), Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, Iraklion, Greece.",vivitor@iesl.forth.gr,"Chaban, Antonina/AAL-7374-2020","Chaban, Antonina/0000-0003-3536-9871; Andrianakis, Michalis/0000-0002-2572-342X; DEIANA, RITA/0000-0002-3736-9181","European project Integrated Platform for the European Research Infrastructure on Cultural Heritage, IPERION CH Grant [654028]; University of Padova","European project Integrated Platform for the European Research Infrastructure on Cultural Heritage, IPERION CH Grant; University of Padova","The experiments were carried out in the premises of the holographic metrology laboratory at the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (IESL-FORTH) and funded from European project Integrated Platform for the European Research Infrastructure on Cultural Heritage, IPERION CH Grant Agreement: 654028.

Yet the current political climate makes it challenging, even dangerous at times, to engage in such work. In what is being called the 'post-truth' era, there is concern that science is under attack, and I argue that the threat is heightened for Indigenous science. For Indigenous communities and archaeologists, efforts to work in partnership to bring Indigenous perspectives into public view can make one a target for bullying, aggression, and hostility. This can be damaging and have serious negative repercussions including producing further trauma for communities and individuals. Drawing on Indigenous epistemologies, I propose a model of 'braiding knowledge' to create space for multiple ways of knowing that complement each other, arguing that such symbiosis is necessary for our contemporary forms of knowledge production, particularly in the current political climate. I provide the example of Archibald's approach to 'Indigenous storywork' as one method for archaeologists to explore, presenting examples drawn from research and teaching contexts to demonstrate the potential of arts-based research methods, such as graphic narratives, augmented reality, and animation. I propose these methods of storywork as worthy of further exploration by archaeologists in the current divisive political climate and as we face a world in crisis as one way of increasing science literacy. I argue that they have the capacity to 'mobilize knowledge', allowing archaeologists to reach diverse groups, creating space for knowledge exchange and connecting across differences.","[Atalay, Sonya] Univ Massachusetts, Anthropol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Atalay, S (corresponding author), UMass, Dept Anthropol, 240 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",atalay@umass.edu,,,,,,,51,6,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1465-5187,1753-5530,,PUBLIC ARCHAEOL,Public Archaeol.,1-Oct,2020,4-Jan,,,,37,52,,10.1080/14655187.2020.1781492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14655187.2020.1781492,,20-Jul,16,Archaeology,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology,6I6IR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000555127900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We consider the large-scale features of the climate change, pointing out some of the major differences between the different sets of experiments. We show in particular that systematic differences between PMIP1 and PMIP2 simulations are due to the interactive ocean, such as the amplification of the African monsoon at the Mid-Holocene or the change in precipitation in mid-latitudes at the LGM.

Furthermore, the role of dust in the formation of regional climate is considered to be crucial. In this work, the regional climatology for the Arabian Peninsula has been studied by employing a high resolution state of the art atmospheric model that included sophisticated physical parameterization schemes and online treatment of natural aerosol particles. The simulations covered a 30-year period (1986-2015) with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial distance of 9 km. The main focus was given to the spatial and temporal variations of mean temperature and temperature extremes, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity. The results were evaluated using in situ measurements indicating a good agreement. An examination of possible climatic changes during the present climate was also performed through a comprehensive analysis of the trends of mean temperature and temperature extremes.

They contribute to human welfare, albeit potential negative environmental effects should be properly addressed. Indeed, the environmental impact of aquaculture is lower than using wild captures. Therefore, shrimp aquaculture is reviewed in relation to bioremediation and sustainability, from an ecological perspective. Since metagenomics has great potential for aquaculture, an experimental research using biofilms on whiteleg shrimp effluents is also included, as a proof of concept, given the lack of published results. That revealed a great diversity of microbes: Bacteria, Archaea, Viridiplantae, Fungi and Protozoa. They included 972 species, grouped in 638 genera and 221 families. Interestingly, the Basic Local-Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm, against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases, identified 12 species (or genera as spp.) involved in nitrification processes, which are relevant from an ecological point of view, using a restrictive threshold of >= 97%. They includedCandidatus nitrosopumilus,Nitratireductor aquibiodomus,Nitratireductorspp.,Nitratiruptorspp.,Nitriliruptorspp.,Nitrosococcusspp.,Nitrosomonas aestuarii,Nitrosomonas marina,Nitrosomonasspp.,Nitrosopumilus maritimus,Nitrospinaspp. andNitrospiraspp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of comprehensive metagenomics on microbiotas ofLitopenaeus vannameieffluents. These results have clear implications for such cultures, mainly related to nitrification enhancement, as well as worldwide aquaculture bioremediation and environmental sustainability, in general. That is especially relevant to ameliorate pollution, which is particularly, in the current scenario of climate change and global warming.","[Mendoza, Oscar; Ramirez, Beder; Sandoval, John] Univ Nacl Tumbes, Fac Ingn Pesquera & Ciencias Mar, Dept Acad Acuicultura, Tumbes, Peru; [Pretell, Krizia] Inca Biotec, Dept Acuicultura, Tumbes, Peru; [Caballero, Jose Luis; Dorado, Gabriel] Univ Cordoba, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario ceiA3, Campus Rabanales C6-1-E17, Cordoba 14071, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Tumbes; Universidad de Cordoba,"Dorado, G (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Campus Excelencia Int Agroalimentario ceiA3, Campus Rabanales C6-1-E17, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",bb1dopeg@uco.es,"Mendoza, Oscar Augusto/GQR-1866-2022; Caballero, José L./L-2067-2014","Mendoza, Oscar Augusto/0000-0002-9637-6250; Caballero, José L./0000-0002-2678-4849; PRETELL, KRIZIA/0000-0003-3711-2279","National University of Tumbes; Ministerio de Econoia y Competitividad (MINECO) and Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (MINECO and INIA) [RF2012-00002-C02-02]; Consejeria de Agricultura y Pesca [041/C/2007, 75/C/2009, 56/C/2010]; Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia [P1-AGR-7322]; Junta de Andalucia [AGR-248]; Universidad de Cordoba (Ayuda a Grupos), Spain","National University of Tumbes; Ministerio de Econoia y Competitividad (MINECO) and Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (MINECO and INIA); Consejeria de Agricultura y Pesca(Junta de Andalucia); Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Universidad de Cordoba (Ayuda a Grupos), Spain","We thank the support of the National University of Tumbes and the company Inca' Biotec, for their support in the development of this research.

Phytoremediation is particularly interesting for Brazil, given the country's rich biodiversity and climate. This mini-review covers some of the most important results in phytoremediation studies carried out in Brazil to date, with a particular focus on the potential of the Brazilian flora for phytostabilization and phytoextraction, the two main subcategories of phytoremediation.

In order to project future plausible scenarios of marine biodiversity at the scale of the whole Mediterranean basin, the current challenge is to develop an explicit representation of the multispecies spatial dynamics under the combined influence of fishing pressure and climate change. Not with standing the advanced state-of-the-art modeling of food webs in the region, no previous studies have projected the consequences of climate change on marine ecosystems in an integrated way, considering changes in ocean dynamics, in phyto- and zoo-plankton productions, shifts in Mediterranean species distributions and their trophic interactions at the whole basin scale. We used an integrated modeling chain including a high-resolution regional climate model, a regional biogeochemistry model and a food web model OSMOSE to project the potential effects of climate change on biomass and catches for a wide array of species in the Mediterranean Sea. We showed that projected climate change would have large consequences for marine biodiversity by the end of the 21st century under a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5 with current fishing mortality). The total biomass of high trophic level species (fish and macroinvertebrates) is projected to increase by 5 and 22% while total catch is projected to increase by 0.3 and 7% by 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, respectively. However, these global increases masked strong spatial and inter-species contrasts. The bulk of increase in catch and biomass would be located in the southeastern part of the basin while total catch could decrease by up to 23% in the western part. Winner species would mainly belong to the pelagic group, are thermophilic and/or exotic, of smaller size and of low trophic level while loser species are generally large-sized, some of them of great commercial interest, and could suffer from a spatial mismatch with potential prey subsequent to a contraction or shift of their geographic range. Given the already poor conditions of exploited resources, our results suggest the need for fisheries management to adapt to future changes and to incorporate climate change impacts in future management strategy evaluation.","[Moullec, Fabien; Drira, Sabrine; Guilhaumon, Francois; Velez, Laure; Shin, Yunne-Jai] Univ Montpelier, MARBEC, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Barrier, Nicolas] Univ Montpelier, IRD, IFREMER, MARBEC,CNRS, Sete, France; [Guilhaumon, Francois] Univ Reunion, Lab Excellence CORAIL, ENTROPIE, IRD,CNRS, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Marsaleix, Patrick; Ulses, Caroline] Univ Toulouse, Lab Aerol, CNRS, UPS, Toulouse, France; [Somot, Samuel] Univ Toulouse, CNRM, CNRS, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Shin, Yunne-Jai] Univ Cape Town, Marine Res Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Rondebosch, South Africa",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); University of La Reunion; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Cape Town,"Moullec, F (corresponding author), Univ Montpelier, MARBEC, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier, France.",fabien.moullec@ird.ir,"Somot, Samuel/A-7585-2008; Marsaleix, Patrick/Q-3389-2019; Guilhaumon, francois/GPX-7180-2022; Shin, Yunne-Jai/A-7575-2012","Marsaleix, Patrick/0000-0002-4506-5209; Guilhaumon, francois/0000-0003-4707-8932; Shin, Yunne-Jai/0000-0002-7259-9265; Somot, Samuel/0000-0002-5066-2921; Barrier, Nicolas/0000-0002-1693-4719; velez, laure/0000-0001-9555-6770","French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation; USBIO project of the LabEx CeMEB, an ANR Investissements d'avenir program [ANR-10-LABX-04-01]; SOMBEE project of the joint BiodivERsA and Belmont Forum call BiodivScen 2018 [ANR-18-EBI4-0003-01]","French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation; USBIO project of the LabEx CeMEB, an ANR Investissements d'avenir program(French National Research Agency (ANR)); SOMBEE project of the joint BiodivERsA and Belmont Forum call BiodivScen 2018","FM was funded by a Ph.D. grant from the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation.

Paradoxically, I argue, their smallness allows them to connect effectively with large planetary events, in a movement edouard Glissant calls Mondialite, since they can function away from the stifling forces of globalization driven by continental powers. Virgin Islands writer Tiphanie Yanique declared the Caribbean as Ground Zero for Climate Change. This essay will explore her claim through a series of poems, philosophical essays, and installation art from Martinique and Guadeloupe. Thus, Aime Cesaire's apparent prison-island is precisely what links Caribbean subjects to a world-geography of Negritude; Suzanne Roussi Cesaire's Martinique connects, through the tail of a hurricane, with the rest of the Antilles and the world. Guadeloupean artist Guy Gabon's installation, Yue#sororite puts women climate refugees at the forefront of resistance to global warming. The hope put into play by these poets and artists can only be activated, the essay ultimately argues, if the demonstrated tendency of humans to devour their planet through colonization and over-consumption can make room to an ethics of ecological love.","[Loichot, Valerie] Emory Univ, Dept French & Italian, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Loichot, V (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept French & Italian, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1740-9292,1740-9306,,CONTEMP FR FRANCOPH,Contemp.

From its origins has shown a clear focus on environmental education, following the naturalist principles of the innovative instructional models that ruled the initial academic programs. It nowadays maintains the same spirit and our school will turn 80 in 2021, responding to new educational demands trough a diversity of actions and projects such as Climantica. This has been one of the most relevant both for its academic and cultural impact in our community in the last decade. At the same time, the academic dimension evolves to respond to the emerging needs in teaching and learning trough the application of innovative models. In this continuous search for better learning environments, the transcurricular approach based on ethics of care and the collaborative work are in sintony with the participation in both national and international projects, such as Climantica. In Mexico City, as citizens of a country that has already felt the serious effects of extreme weather, we are increasingly concerned about taking action at educational, social and infrastructural levels. Along with the scientific facts, we are working in interdisciplinary activities linking social subjects like Mexican history, arts, technology, among others. Additionally, in recent years we have developed an innovative approach to interrelate science and social curricula with the cross curricular citizenship and ethics of care approach, which is showing encouraging results. We have no doubt in recognizing Climantica as the top project that eight years ago started a new era on climate change awareness in our community. Now we face the next challenging action to co-organize Clinuintica Themamerica in Mexico in spring 2021, framed in the 15th and 80th anniversary of Climantica and Colegio Madrid's foundation.

This article seeks to expand application possibilities by exploring the feasibility of solar cooling integrated facades, as decentralized self-sufficient cooling modules on different warm regions. The climate feasibility of solar electric and solar thermal concepts is evaluated based on solar availability and local cooling demands to be met by current technical possibilities. Numerical calculations are employed for the evaluation, considering statistical climate data; cooling demands per orientation from several simulated scenarios; and state-of-the-art efficiency values of solar cooling technologies, from the specialized literature. The main results show that, in general, warm-dry climates and east/west orientations are better suited for solar cooling facade applications, compared to humid regions and north/south orientations. Results from the base scenario show promising potential for solar thermal technologies, reaching a theoretical solar fraction of 100% in several cases. Application possibilities expand when higher solar array area and lower tilt angle on panels are considered, but these imply aesthetical and constructional constraints for facade design. Finally, recommendations are drafted considering prospects for the exploration of suitable technologies for each location, and facade design considerations for the optimization of the solar input per orientation.","[Prieto, Alejandro; Knaack, Ulrich; Klein, Tillmann] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural, Facade Res Grp,Engn Technol, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Auer, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Architecture, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Delft University of Technology; Technical University of Munich,"Prieto, A (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Dept Architectural, Facade Res Grp,Engn Technol, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",A.I.PrietoHoces@tudelft.nl; U.Knaack@tudelft.nl; Thomas.Auer@tum.de; T.Klein@tudelft.nl,,"Knaack, Ulrich/0000-0001-9998-6428; Prieto, Alejandro/0000-0003-3386-7682","CONICYT, the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile [7484/2013]","CONICYT, the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research of Chile","This paper is part of the ongoing PhD research project titled COOLFACADE: Architectural integration of solar cooling technologies in the building envelope, developed within the Facade Research Group (FRG) of the Department of Architectural Engineering + Technology, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).

The introduction of dynamic components in the building envelope makes the characterization of conventional static performance indices insufficient in giving a clear picture of the performance of the component in question. Measurements have been performed on a state-of-the-art window that integrates PCM using a large scale climate simulator. The glazing unit consists of a four-pane glazing with an integrated layer that dynamically controls the solar transmittance (prismatic glass) in the outer glazing cavity. The innermost cavity is filled with a phase change material. This article presents and assesses the series of measurements and the related methodologies with the aim of investigating the thermal behavior and thermal mass activation of the PCM-filled window. The experiments have been carried out using several static and dynamic test cycles comprised of temperature and solar radiation cycling. A conventional double-pane window has also been experimental investigated using the same test cycles for reference purpose. It was found that even for temperatures similar to a warm day in Nordic climate, the potential latent heat storage capacity of the PCM was fully activated, but relatively long periods of sun combined with high exterior temperatures are needed.

The Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's slope test estimator, and innovative trend detection (phi) (ITA) methods were used to detect the trends. According to the findings, average annual precipitation shows a descending trend (phi = -0.17) in most stations. An increasing trend was found only in Fuyang station (phi = 1.02). In all stations, the trends of mean annual temperature (phi = 0.36) were abruptly increased. During the past 57 years, the mean air temperature has considerably increased by 12 degrees C/10a. The river streamflow showed a dramatic declining trend in all stations for the duration of the study period (1960-2016) (phi = -4.29). The climate variability in the study region affects the quantity of the streamflow. The river streamflow exhibits decreasing trends from 1965 onwards. The main possible reason for the declining stream flow in the study area is the declining amount of precipitation on some specific months due to the occurrence of climate change. The outcomes of this study could create awareness for the policymakers and members of the scientific community, informing them about the hydroclimatic evolutions across the study basin, and become an inordinate resource for advanced scientific research.","[Girma, Abel; Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Song, Xinshan; Qin, Tianlin; Dorjsuren, Batsuren; Gedefaw, Mohammed; Abiyu, Asaminew] Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Girma, Abel] Univ Gondar, Dept Nat Resource Management, Gondar 196, Ethiopia; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Qin, Tianlin; Gedefaw, Mohammed; Fikir, Dagim; Wang, Jianwei] State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dorjsuren, Batsuren] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Environm & Forest Engn, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Fikir, Dagim] Univ Padua, Dept Environm Land & Agr, Padua, Italy; [Yadamjav, Otgonbayar] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia",Donghua University; University of Gondar; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; National University of Mongolia; University of Padua; National University of Mongolia,"Girma, A (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Girma, A (corresponding author), Univ Gondar, Dept Nat Resource Management, Gondar 196, Ethiopia.",abelethiopia@yahoo.com; yandh@iwhr.com; wanghao@iwhr.com; newmountain@163.com; tianling406@gmail.com; batsuren@seas.num.edu.mn; mohammedgedefaw@gmail.com; asaminewab@yahoo.com; dagtfsm@gmail.com; wangjianwei199063@163.com; otgonbayar_ya@num.edu.mn,"Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/AFV-4937-2022; Abate, Dagm/ABU-3881-2022; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/Q-6986-2018","Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/0000-0002-2412-1507; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/0000-0002-7864-8291; Abate, Dagm/0000-0002-3597-4062; Girma, Abel/0000-0002-3460-6284","China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research - National Key Research and Development Project, China [2016YFA0601503]","China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research - National Key Research and Development Project, China","The authors would like to thank China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research for financing this research.

Several studies have shown that the increasing building energy demand is associated with increased space-cooling ownership and building footprint. The energy demand is predicted to grow further with the conditions of global warming and the phenomenon of urban heat islands. Building designers have been using state-of-the-art transient simulation tools to evaluate energy-efficient envelopes with present-day weather files that are generated with historical weather datasets for any specific location. Designing buildings with historical climatic conditions makes the buildings vulnerable to the predicted climate change impacts. In this paper, a weather file generator was developed to generate Indian future weather files using a geo-filtering-based spatial technique, as well as the temporal downscaling and machine learning (ML)-based bias correction approach proposed by Belcher et al. The future weather files of the three representative concentration pathways of 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 could be generated for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2090, and 2100. Currently, the outputs of the second-generation Canadian Earth System Model are being used to create future weather files that will aid architects, urban designers, and planners in developing a built environment that is resilient to climate change. The novelty lies in using observed historical data from present-day weather files on the typical meteorological year for testing and training ML models. The typical meteorological weather files are composed of the concatenation of the monthly weather datasets from different years, which are referred to for testing and training ML models for bias correction.","[Manapragada, Naga Venkata Sai Kumar] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Environm Performance & Design Lab, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Shukla, Anoop Kumar; Shetty, Deepika; Boorla, Venkataramana] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Sch Architecture & Planning, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Pignatta, Gloria] Univ New South Wales UNSW, Fac Arts Design & Architecture, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Yenneti, Komali] Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, Wolverhampton WV1 1LY, England; [Nayak, Bibhu Kalyan] Manipal Univ Jaipur, Sch Architecture & Design, Jaipur 303007, Rajasthan, India",Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE); University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Wolverhampton; Manipal University Jaipur,"Shukla, AK (corresponding author), Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Sch Architecture & Planning, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India.;Pignatta, G (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales UNSW, Fac Arts Design & Architecture, Sch Built Environm, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",anoopgeomatics@gmail.com; g.pignatta@unsw.edu.au,"; Shukla, Dr Anoop Kumar/AAB-9364-2020; Nayak, Bibhu Kalyan/S-2413-2017; Pignatta, Gloria/I-2506-2019","Boorla, Venkataramana/0000-0002-9694-7877; Shukla, Dr Anoop Kumar/0000-0002-7052-8287; Nayak, Bibhu Kalyan/0000-0002-0906-9632; Pignatta, Gloria/0000-0003-3231-4568",,,,,45,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,22,,,,,,15191,10.3390/su142215191,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142215191,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6K7WR,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000887707800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since about 1970, the principle has also been used on a broader scale for the purification of wastewater. However, in the early days, the anaerobic technique was only used for treatment of wastewaters with a very high content of easily degradable organic substances. Consequently, the fist full-scale wastewater treatment plant was realized in the sugar industry. Later on, it became obvious that there were many more potential applications. Nowadays, thousands of full-scale anaerobic wastewater treatment plants are operational. They are used to treat wastewater produced in the agricultural industry and also in the chemical industry. Since 1985, there has also been a breakthrough in the area of purification of municipal wastewater. Successful plants are not only operational in tropical climates such as India, Colombia, and Brazil, but it has also proved to be possible to treat municipal wastewater successfully using anaerobic treatment in subtropical countries like Portugal. Anaerobic technology is used as it has benefits in comparison with other techniques, such as, for example, lower energy consumption, biogas production, production of less sewage sludge, lower space requirements, and lower overall costs. With respect to the future, it can be concluded that there is strong pressure to use anaerobic treatment on a much wider scale. There are still many areas where successful use might be possible. Examples of future application are treatment of industrial wastewaters that currently receive aerobic treatment. It is anticipated that anaerobic treatment, in part due to new technical modifications, will make a big jump ahead. New ideas and new applications have made anaerobic treatment into a competitive technology in new fields such as the chemical industry. It is therefore necessary to continue fundamental research on anaerobic treatment for a number of years. In the Netherlands, a foundation was established with the aim to provide financial support to research projects. The Netherlands Environmental Technology Foundation (NETFO) was initiated by a censortium consisting of institutes, consultants, and contractors.

During events of heat and moisture advection into the Arctic, increases in tropospheric temperature and moisture impact clouds, in turn impacting longwave (LW) radiation. State-of-the-art satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis consistently reveal an enhancement of summer Arctic monthly OLR cooling ranging 1.5-4Wm(-2) during months with anomalously high thermodynamic advection. This cooling anomaly is found to be of the same magnitude or slightly larger than associated downwelling LW surface warming anomalies. We identify a relationship between large-scale circulation variability and changing cloud properties permitting LW radiation at both the surface and top of the atmosphere to respond to variability in atmospheric thermodynamics. Driven by anomalous advection of warm air, the corresponding enhanced OLR cooling signal on monthly time scales represents an important buffer to regional Arctic warming.","[Sedlar, Joseph] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Tjernstrom, Michael] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol, Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Stockholm University,"Sedlar, J (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Norrkoping, Sweden.",joseph.sedlar@smhi.se,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Sedlar, Joseph/AAD-1060-2022; Tjernström, Michael/AAF-3481-2020","Sedlar, Joseph/0000-0003-3101-9401; Tjernstrom, Michael/0000-0002-6908-7410",,,,,48,24,24,2,33,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Urban warming can be attenuated by reducing the solar heat gain that increases building's temperature during the hot season. Solar heat can be mainly reduced by increasing the insulation between the exterior and interior of the building, as well as by shading the building surface from direct sun exposure. A sustainable technology for improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the use of green roofs and green walls that: allow the physical shading of the building and promote evapotranspiration in summer; increase the thermal insulation in winter. An experimental test was carried out at the University of Bari (Italy, 41 degrees 05 'N, 16 degrees 53 'E). Three prototypes of building vertical wall, made with perforated bricks, were designed: two vertical walls were covered with plants (one with Pandorea jasminoides variegated, the second with Rhyncospermum jasminoides) while the third wall was kept uncovered and was used as control. A system composed by a data logger and sensors was used to measure and record the following parameters: temperature of the wall surface under solar radiation and of the surface on the other side of the wall, solar radiation falling on the wall, external air temperature and wind speed. During summer 2014 the diurnal temperatures of the control surface exposed to the solar radiation were higher by about 4 degrees C compared to the temperatures recorded on both the vertical walls covered with Rhyncospermum jasminoides and Pandorea jasminoides variegated.

Climate adaptive building shells (CABS) are among the most promising alternatives for achieving sustainability goals by reducing energy consumption. Regardless of technological developments, this type of system has a reputation for increasing the distraction of occupants and consequently decreasing their satisfaction level. This research has been developed to focus on the occupant-centric study rather than technological advancements of the system. This study introduces the user-facade interaction scenarios and applies this classification on CABS office buildings. The purpose of this study is to introduce a new multi-domain taxonomy for CABS office buildings and update the database of this system by adding a new variable focusing on occupants. The study was designed on the foundation found with PRISMA methodology which highlights the lack of occupant-centric research on CABS. The research carried on as a qualitative method with an inductive approach which with the literature review introduced the user-facade interaction scenarios and the latest update of the CABS database. Accordingly, the office cases were categorized within different climatic zones, and later as a correlational study, each case was studied based on user-facade interaction scenarios. Analysis of case databases according to user-facade interaction types clears the lack of development in the majority of scenarios. Lastly, the study concluded by introducing a novel multi-domain taxonomy of CABS office buildings by considering user-facade interaction scenarios. The further value of this study is to be a foundation for future studies on CABS office buildings by considering the occupants as a primary element of the research.","[Hafizi, Nazgol; Vural, Sadiye Mujdem] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Architecture, Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Hafizi, N (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Architecture, Dept Architecture, Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",nazgol.hafizi@emu.edu.tr; mujdem.vural@emu.edu.tr,"Vural, Sadiye Müjdem/AAW-2311-2021","Vural, Sadiye Müjdem/0000-0001-7271-1846; Hafizi, Nazgol/0000-0003-4028-3749",,,,,56,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUL,2022,14,,,,,,5268,10.3390/en15145268,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15145268,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,3K0TV,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000833799500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In West Sahel, climate conditions characterized by reduced occurrence of wet days are likely to emerge before 2036, leading to the possible emergence of a dryer climate in 2028-2052. In East Sahel, a wetter precipitation regime characterized by increased occurrence of very wet days is likely to emerge before 2054. Results do not provide a clear indication about a possible climate shift in the onset and length of the rainy season. Although uncertainty in climate model future projections still limits the robust determination of TOE locally, this study provides reliable time constraints to the expected climate shift in West Africa at the sub-regional scale, supporting adaptation measures to the future change in the precipitation regime.","[Gaetani, Marco] Sorbonne Univ, Lab Atmosphere Milieux Observat Spatiales LATMOS, UMR CNRS 8190, UVSQ, Paris, France; [Gaetani, Marco] Scuola Univ Super IUSS, Pavia, Italy; [Janicot, Serge; Famien, Adjoua Moise] Sorbonne Univ, Lab Oceanog & Climat Expt & Approches Numer, LOCEAN, IRD,CNRS,MNHN, Paris, France; [Vrac, Mathieu] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & & Environm LSCE IPSL, CNRS CEA UVSQ, UMR8212, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Famien, Adjoua Moise] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, LAPAMF UFR SSMT, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Sultan, Benjamin] Univ Avignon, Univ Antilles, Univ Reunion, Univ Guyane,Univ Montpellier,ESPACE DEV,IRD, 500 RueJean Francois Breton, F-34093 Montpellier, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; IUSS PAVIA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Avignon Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of La Reunion,"Gaetani, M (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Lab Atmosphere Milieux Observat Spatiales LATMOS, UMR CNRS 8190, UVSQ, Paris, France.;Gaetani, M (corresponding author), Scuola Univ Super IUSS, Pavia, Italy.",marco.gaetani@iusspavia.it,"Gaetani, Marco/AAQ-7802-2020; Sultan, Benjamin/C-8957-2012","Gaetani, Marco/0000-0003-2923-6773; Sultan, Benjamin/0000-0003-0416-0338; Vrac, Mathieu/0000-0002-6176-0439; FAMIEN, Adjoua Moise Landry/0000-0002-4551-7033","ANR [ANR-10-LABX-18-01, ANR-11-IDEX-0004-17-EURE-0006]; NERC/DFID Future Climate For Africa programme under the AMMA-2050 project [NE/M019934/1]; NERC [NE/M020428/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); NERC/DFID Future Climate For Africa programme under the AMMA-2050 project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work benefited from the French state aid managed by the ANR under the Investissements d'avenir programmes ANR-10-LABX-18-01 and ANR-11-IDEX-0004-17-EURE-0006, and received partial funding from the NERC/DFID Future Climate For Africa programme under the AMMA-2050 project (grant number NE/M019934/1).

The effects of a general set of agriculture and water management adaptations on the size of the world's water-stressed population were assessed for a specific but consistent scenario on socio-economic development and climate change during the 21st century. To maintain consistency with agricultural land use change, we developed a grid-based water supply-demand model integrated with an agro-land use model and evaluated the water-stressed population using a water withdrawals-to-availability ratio for river basins. Our evaluation shows that, if no adaptation options are implemented, the world's water-stressed population will increase from 1.8 billion in 2000 to about 3.3 billion in 2050, and then remain fairly constant. The population and economic growth rather than climate change will be dominant factors of this increase. Significant increase in the water-stressed population will occur in regions such as North Africa and the Middle East, India, Other South Asia, China and Southeast Asia. The key adaptation options differ by region, depending on dominant crops, increase in crop demand and so on. For instance, 'improvement of irrigation efficiency' and 'enhancement of reclamation water' seem to be one of important options to reduce the water stress in Southeast Asia, and North Africa and the Middle East, respectively. The worldwide implementation of adaptation options could decrease the water-stressed population by about 5 % and 7-17 %, relative to the scenario without adaptations, in 2050 and 2100, respectively.","[Hayashi, Ayami; Akimoto, Keigo; Tomoda, Toshimasa] Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth RITE, Syst Anal Grp, Kizugawa, Kyoto 6190292, Japan; [Akimoto, Keigo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Art & Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Kii, Masanobu] Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan",Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth; University of Tokyo; Kagawa University,"Hayashi, A (corresponding author), Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth RITE, Syst Anal Grp, 9-2 Kizugawadai, Kizugawa, Kyoto 6190292, Japan.",ayami@rite.or.jp,"Kii, Masanobu/AAE-6786-2021","HAYASHI, Ayami/0000-0002-3342-6492; Kii, Masanobu/0000-0003-1774-4308","Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This study has been conducted as part of the 'ALPS' (alternative pathways towards sustainable development and climate stabilization) project, supported by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan.

We use correlation-based metrics along with a simple classification-based on when the top layer soil temperature () rises above freezing point during the annual freeze-thaw season, to evaluate the influence of snowmelt on SM. Our results show considerable differences across reanalyses as well as CanSIPS hindcasts regarding timing of maximum SWE () occurrences as well as the onset of thawing of the frozen soil. Correlation statistics indicate that strongly influences SM. As a measure of the persistence of this relationship, a decay time is defined by lag in days over which the correlation of SM with lagged decays to 1/e of its peak value. For a majority of grid cells over ENH this decay time is less than 45 days, which suggests does not strongly influence the SM beyond subseasonal time scales. The interannual autocorrelation of SM indicates strong persistence over subseasonal time scales, consistently across reanalyses as well as CanSIPS hindcasts. However, intra-seasonal autocorrelations of ERA-Interim and MERRA-Land SM over North America show anomalous sudden decline of SMM compared to the other products, likely due to the offline forcing of atmospheric variables which blocks the atmosphere's response to land feedbacks. One of the models used in CanSIPS, the Canadian Climate Model version 4 (CanCM4), also shows a sudden decline of intra-seasonal autocorrelation over Central Asia which is most likely due to weak land-atmosphere coupling over the region. Lag-lead correlation statistics between SM and T2M during the soil thaw period suggests that SM anomalies have measurable lagged influence on T2M with varying decay time over different regions and across different datasets.","[Ambadan, Jaison Thomas; Berg, Aaron A.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Merryfield, William J.; Lee, Woo-Sung] Univ Victoria, Canadian Ctr Climate Modelling & Anal, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Guelph; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); University of Victoria,"Ambadan, JT (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, Guelph, ON, Canada.",jaisont@uoguelph.ca; aberg@uoguelph.ca; bill.merryfield@canada.ca; woosung.lee@canada.ca,"Berg, Aaron/AAU-3547-2021","Berg, Aaron/0000-0001-8438-5662",Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) network under the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research (CCAR) initiative of Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada,Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) network under the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research (CCAR) initiative of Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada,"This work was supported by the Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE: http://www.cansise.ca) network, a network project funded under the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research (CCAR) initiative of Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada.

This study is trying to extract the co-benefit on air quality, public health and economic costs in China and worldwide from China's GHGs mitigation policy. We construct two scenarios, with moderate climate mitigation action worldwide, versus more stringent climate mitigation action in China. We use the GAINS model to predict the GHGs and air pollutants emissions in the two scenarios, and a state-of-the-art global chemical transport model to simulate the annual PM(2.5)concentrations. We then use IMED|HEL, which is a health assessment model, to estimate the health impacts and economic cost of PM(2.5)pollution in each country. Results show China's mitigation has significant impact on both air quality and health improvement in eastern China and eastern Asia, a little bit impact in the rest of Asia. The improved air quality could avoid 0.37 million premature deaths due to ambient PM(2.5)exposure by 2050s globally, with the majority happening in China. We use the willingness to pay method to estimate the economic benefits from the improved air quailty, and find that the reduced ambient PM(2.5)concentration could avoid $406 billion and $1206 billion economic costs by 2030s and 2050s globally, with China the largest fraction of 98.5% ($400 billion) and 99.5% ($1200 billion), respectively. The reduced ambient PM(2.5)exposure can also avoid 11.3 million cases morbidity globally by 2050s, due to asthma attacks and hospital admissions. Our study shows most of the economic benefits from air quality improvement due to China's mitigation happens in China, followed by the eastern Asia (such as South Korea and Japan) and the rest of Asia. Health improvement is the main fraction of the potential benefits, such as saving health expenditure, increasing the work time.","[Xie, Yang] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yang] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data Based Precis Med, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yang] Beihang Univ, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Big Data Based Precis Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yazhen; Ma, Teng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Xie, Mingjun; Li, Baodi; Zhang, Hui] Gansu Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuqiang] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27710 USA",Beihang University; Beihang University; Beihang University; Peking University; Duke University,"Zhang, YQ (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",Yuqiang.Zhang@duke.edu,"Zhang, Yuqiang Alan/C-5027-2015; Xie, Yang/F-8522-2018","Zhang, Yuqiang Alan/0000-0002-9161-7086; Xie, Yang/0000-0002-8864-960X","Natural Science Foundation of China [71903010, 71704005, 51861135102, 71690241, 71690245, 71810107001]; Key Projects of National Key Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2017YFC0213000]; Gansu Provincial Health Industry Research Program Project [GSWSKY2017-28]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Projects of National Key Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Gansu Provincial Health Industry Research Program Project,"This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (71903010, 71704005, 51861135102, 71690241, 71690245, 71810107001), the Key Projects of National Key Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2017YFC0213000), Gansu Provincial Health Industry Research Program Project(GSWSKY2017-28).",,48,12,12,16,68,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The 'everything change', as Margaret Atwood calls it, arguably also impacts on how we aesthetically perceive, interpret and appreciate nature. This article looks at philosophical theories of nature appreciation against global environmental change. The article examines how human-induced global climate change affects the 'scientific' approaches to nature appreciation which base aesthetic judgment on scientific knowledge and the competing 'non-scientific' approaches which emphasise the role of emotions, imagination and stories in the aesthetic understanding of environment. The author claims that both approaches are threatened by global climate change and cannot continue as usual. In particular, he explores aesthetic imagination in contemporary times when our visions about environment are thoroughly coloured by worry and uncertainty and there seems to be little room for awe and wonder, which have traditionally characterised the aesthetic experience of nature. Finally, he proposes that art could stimulate environmental imagining in this age of uncertainty.","[Mikkonen, Jukka] Hist & Art Studies Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy, Helsinki, Finland",,"Mikkonen, J (corresponding author), Hist & Art Studies Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy, Helsinki, Finland.",jukka.mikkonen@protonmail.com,"Mikkonen, Jukka/H-5647-2019","Mikkonen, Jukka/0000-0003-0436-8526",,,,,101,1,1,2,2,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0963-2719,1752-7015,,ENVIRON VALUE,Environ.

However, the main reason for the increasing uptake of this type of solution is their many benefits for the local inhabitants, including recreational value. Previous studies on recreational value focus on studies of existing nature sites that are often much larger than what is considered as new NBS for flood adaptation studies in urban areas. We thus prioritized studies with smaller areas and nature types suitable for urban flood adap-tation and divided them into four common nature types for urban flood adaptation: sustainable urban drainage systems, city parks, nature areas and rivers. We identified 23 primary valuation studies, including both stated and revealed preference studies, and derived two value transfer functions based on meta-regression analysis on existing areas. We investigated trends between values and variables and found that for the purpose of planning of new NBS the size of NBS and population density were determining factors of recreational value. For existing NBS the maximum travelling distance may be included as well. We find that existing state-of-the-art studies over-estimate the recreational with more than a factor of 4 for NBS sizes below 5 ha. Our results are valid in a Eu-ropean context for nature-based solutions below 250 ha and can be applied across different NBS types and sizes.","[Skrydstrup, Julie; Lowe, Roland; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Environm & Resource Engn, Lyngby, Denmark; [Skrydstrup, Julie; Gregersen, Ida Billow] Ramboll, Climate Adaptat & Green Infrastruct, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Koetse, Mark; Aerts, Jeroen C.

Since state of the art models are too computationally expensive for it to be possible to explore their parametric uncertainty in anything approaching a comprehensive fashion, we have developed a simplified system for investigating this problem. By combining the strong points of general circulation models (GCMs), which contain detailed and complex processes, and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs), which are quick and capable of large ensembles, we have developed a loosely coupled model (LCM) which can represent the outputs of a GCM-based Earth system model, using much smaller computational resources. We address the problem of relatively poor representation of precipitation within our EMIC, which prevents us from directly coupling it to a vegetation model, by coupling it to a precomputed transient simulation using a full GCM. The LCM consists of three components: an EMIC (MIROC-lite) which consists of a 2-D energy balance atmosphere coupled to a low resolution 3-D GCM ocean (COCO) including an ocean carbon cycle (an NPZD-type marine ecosystem model); a state of the art vegetation model (Sim-CYCLE); and a database of daily temperature, precipitation, and other necessary climatic fields to drive Sim-CYCLE from a precomputed transient simulation from a state of the art AOGCM. The transient warming of the climate system is calculated from MIROC-lite, with the global temperature anomaly used to select the most appropriate annual climatic field from the pre-computed AOGCM simulation which, in this case, is a 1% pa increasing CO2 concentration scenario. By adjusting the effective climate sensitivity (equivalent to the equilibrium climate sensitivity for an energy balance model) of MIROC-lite, the transient warming of the LCM could be adjusted to closely follow the low sensitivity (with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 4.0K) version of MIROC3.2. By tuning of the physical and biogeochemical parameters it was possible to reasonably reproduce the bulk physical and biogeochemical properties of previously published CO2 stabilisation scenarios for that model. As an example of an application of the LCM, the behavior of the high sensitivity version of MIROC3.2 (with a 6.3 K equilibrium climate sensitivity) is also demonstrated. Given the highly adjustable nature of the model, we believe that the LCM should be a very useful tool for studying uncertainty in global climate change, and we have named the model, JUMP-LCM, after the name of our research group (Japan Uncertainty Modelling Project).","[Tachiiri, K.; Hargreaves, J.

Over 61,000 hourly air temperature maps between 2008 and 2014 are extracted, divided into thermal seasons and LWT, and UHI is calculated by the anomaly between each raster cell and a pixel from Low Plants Local Climate Zone (LCZ) class. UHI daily cycle is analyzed by LWT. Statistical analysis shows that rainy days produce lower median UHI intensities (close to 0 degrees C), while sunny days, especially very cold winter days, produce higher UHI intensities (median values close to 1,5 degrees C). Analysis of the UHI pattern displays a S/SE-N/NW dichotomy in the right bank of the Tagus river and an N-S dichotomy in the Peninsula of Setubal. The UHI effect is more pronounced in Lisbon, particularly in the riverfront area, and on the opposite bank of Tagus due to the shelter effect of frequent N winds. As previous studies have proven, UHI in LMA is mainly a nighttime phenomenon. This methodology may help decision makers to identify critical heating districts as well as weather conditions most conducive to a significant overheating of the urban atmosphere.","[Reis, Claudia; Lopes, Antonio] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Geog Studies, Inst Geog & Spatial Planning IGOT, Rua Branca Edmee Marques, P-1600276 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Antonio] Associated Lab Terra, Lisbon, Portugal; [Nouri, A.

In this systematic review, we analyze 71 place-based studies of green infrastructure (GI) justice in cities worldwide. We draw from environmental justice scholarship, as well as climate and water justice literature to assess the state-of-the-art knowledge of urban GI justice. We examine the way GI is researched to improve our understanding of the types of injustices that exist in GI planning, siting, and implementation, providing rich insights into why injustices exist and pathways to address GI injustice. We find that research on GI justice in cities is growing and expanding its scope in terms of both the types of justice issues analyzed, and the groups of people excluded from the benefits of GI. We find that GI injustice stems from a history of unequal investment and non-participatory decision-making processes, where the unequal distribution of GI is only the tip of the iceberg. To address GI injustice around distribution, cities would have to offset a decades-long lack of investment and inclusivity in decision-making processes. Pathways to achieve GI justice point to assessing unbalanced power structures, directing continuous funding to community engagement programs and greening efforts, leveraging existing infrastructure through the multifunctionality of GI, and dedicating funding mechanisms for safety and maintenance. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the different dimensions of GI that are tailored to the community on the ground, and to monitor progress toward justice.","[Zuniga-Teran, Adriana A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Landscape Architecture & Planning, 803 E First St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Zuniga-Teran, Adriana A.; Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, 803 E First St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Gerlak, Andrea K.; Elder, Alison D.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Tam, Alexander] Harvard Univ, Dept Hist, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Harvard University,"Zuniga-Teran, AA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Landscape Architecture & Planning, 803 E First St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.;Zuniga-Teran, AA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, 803 E First St, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA.",aazuniga@arizona.edu,,,"Morris K.

To examine the relationships, we analyzed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). Our investigation based on this state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis data reveals that 13 out of the 20 months with the highest PM2.5 (corresponding to the highly elevated organic carbon in the particulate organic matter [POM] form) monthly mean mass concentration over the Arctic for 2003-2017 were all in summer (July and August), during which POM of >= 0.5 mu g m(-3) and PM2.5 were positively correlated. This correlation suggests that high PM2.5 in the Arctic is linked to large wildfire contributions and characterized by significant anticyclonic anomalies (i.e. clockwise atmospheric circulation) with anomalous surface warmth and drier conditions over Siberia and subpolar North America, in addition to Europe. A similar climate pattern was also identified through an independent regression analysis for the July and August mean data between the same atmospheric variables and the sign-reversed Scandinavian pattern index. We named this pattern of recent atmospheric circulation anomalies the circum-Arctic wave (CAW) pattern as a manifestation of eastward group-velocity propagation of stationary Rossby waves (i.e. large-scale atmospheric waves). The CAW induces concomitant development of warm anticyclonic anomalies over Europe, Siberia, Alaska, and Canada, as observed in late June 2019. Surprisingly, the extended regression analysis of the 1980-2017 period revealed that the CAW pattern was not prominent before 2003. Understanding the CAW pattern under future climate change and global warming would lead to better prediction of co-occurrences of European heatwaves and large-scale wildfires with air pollution over Siberia, Alaska, and Canada in and around the Arctic in summer.","[Yasunari, Teppei J.] Hokkaido Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Kita Ku, N21W11, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan; [Yasunari, Teppei J.] Hokkaido Univ, Global Stn Arctic Res, GI CoRE, Kita Ku, N21W11, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan; [Yasunari, Teppei J.] Hokkaido Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards Res, Kita Ku, N9W9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Nakamura, Hisashi] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Kim, Kyu-Myong; da Silva, Arlindo M.] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, 8800 Greenbelt Rd, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Choi, Nakbin; Lee, Myong-In] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Tachibana, Yoshihiro] Mie Univ, Fac Bioresources, 1577 Kurimamachiya Cho, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan",Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; University of Tokyo; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Mie University,"Yasunari, TJ (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Arctic Res Ctr, Kita Ku, N21W11, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan.;Yasunari, TJ (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Global Stn Arctic Res, GI CoRE, Kita Ku, N21W11, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan.;Yasunari, TJ (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards Res, Kita Ku, N9W9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",t.j.yasunari@arc.hokudai.ac.jp,"; Lee, Myong-In/F-3578-2010; Yasunari, Teppei/E-5374-2010","Choi, Nakbin/0000-0002-8696-5916; Lee, Myong-In/0000-0001-8983-8624; Nakamura, Hisashi/0000-0003-1791-6325; Yasunari, Teppei/0000-0002-9896-9404","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) [JPMXD1300000000]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI) [17H02958, 17KT0066, 18H01278, 19H01976, 19H05668, 19H05698, 19H05702, 20H01970, 20K12197]; Japanese Ministry of Environment through Environment Research and Technology Development Fund [JPMEERF20192004]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS II) [JPMXD1420318865]","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS KAKENHI)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japanese Ministry of Environment through Environment Research and Technology Development Fund(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea); Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology through the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS II)","We want to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments in revising the paper.

Such an adjustment might be permissible if energy taxes as indirect taxes are applied on inputs during the production process. Compliance with the Most Favoured Nation principle has less practical importance than the not-yet settled likeness discussion under the National Treatment principle. Consequently, since the compatibility of carbon-related border tax adjustment measures is partly contested, potential justifications such as the conservation of exhaustible national resources or the protection of health (Art. XX GATT) become relevant. The application of the necessity and proportionality test requires that carbon measures are tailored so as to substantially contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives and do not create any arbitrary or unjustified discrimination.","[Kaufmann, Christine; Weber, Rolf H.] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Kaufmann, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",christine.kaufmann@rwi.uzh.ch; rolf.weber@rwi.uzh.ch,,,,,,,76,25,25,2,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2011,4,,,,497,525,,10.1017/S1474745611000292,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1474745611000292,,,29,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,848DD,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000297028300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the cuticular (or external leaf surface) pathway, as well as other non-stomatal ecosystem surfaces, still pose a major challenge to translating our knowledge into models. Dynamic mechanistic models including complex leaf surface chemistry have been able to accurately reproduce measured bidirectional fluxes in the past, but their computational expense and challenging implementation into existing air quality models call for steady-state simplifications. Here we qualitatively compare two semi-empirical state-of-the-art parameterizations of a unidirectional non-stomatal resistance (R-w) model after Massad et al. (2010), and a quasi-bidirectional non-stomatal compensation-point (chi(w)) model after Wichink Kruit et al. (2010), with NH3 flux measurements from five European sites. In addition, we tested the feasibility of using backward-looking moving averages of air NH3 concentrations as a proxy for prior NH3 uptake and as a driver of an alternative parameterization of non-stomatal emission potentials (Gamma(w)) for bidirectional non-stomatal exchange models. Results indicate that the R-w-only model has a tendency to underestimate fluxes, while the chi(w) model mainly overestimates fluxes, although systematic underestimations can occur under certain conditions, depending on temperature and ambient NH3 concentrations at the site. The proposed Gamma(w) parameterization revealed a clear functional relationship be-tween backward-looking moving averages of air NH3 concentrations and non-stomatal emission potentials, but further reduction of uncertainty is needed for it to be useful across different sites. As an interim solution for improving flux predictions, we recommend reducing the minimum allowed R-w and the temperature response parameter in the unidirectional model and revisiting the temperature-dependent Gamma(w) parameterization of the bidirectional model.","[Schrader, Frederik; Brummer, Christian; Zoll, Undine] Thunen Inst Climate Smart Agr, Braunschweig, Germany; [Flechard, Chris R.] INRA, Agrocampus Ouest, SAS UMR1069, Rennes, France; [Kruit, Roy J.

The Mann Whitney test was used to compare the responses, p <= 0.05. Results showed differences between groups, in which PW considered wushu a valid content to teach aspects related to martial arts for schoolchildren, while NPW believed to be inefficient. Both groups identified wushu as an activity that meets and exceeds the needs of motor, cognitive and socioaffective development in schoolchildren. On the other hand, about 30% of NPWs indicated that wushu is difficult to use in schoolchildren, and 40% of NPWs reported that wushu practices during initial teacher training were only partially or not sufficiently taught.

The model is employed for the identification of changes in the qualitative systems behavior in response to changes in boundary conditions. The most notable result is the occurrence of saddle-node bifurcations against changes in those quantities which govern the heat balance of the system, i.e., the planetary albedo, the insolation, and the CO2 concentration. These findings are remarkable insofar as they indicate that anthropogenic perturbations of the planetary albedo, such as sulphur emissions and/or land-use changes, or natural variations in insolation and CO2 concentration could trigger abrupt transitions between different monsoon regimes.","Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; Univ E Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Tyndall Ctr Headquarters, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; Oboukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Moscow, Russia",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of East Anglia; Russian Academy of Sciences; Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences,"Zickfeld, K (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",zickfeld@pik-potsdam.de,"Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim/B-2607-2012; Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim/O-3873-2019","Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim/0000-0001-7453-4935; Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim/0000-0001-7453-4935",,,,,13,70,70,0,11,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

Short-term elevations in PM2.5 increase the relative risk of acute CV events by 1% to 3% within a few days. Longer-term exposures over several years increase this risk by a larger magnitude (similar to 10%), which is partially attributable to the development of cardiometabolic conditions (e.g., hypertension and diabetes mellitus). As such, ambient PM2.5 poses a major threat to global public health. In this review, the authors provide an overview of air pollution and health, including assessment of exposure, impact on CV outcomes, mechanistic underpinnings, and impact of air pollution reduction strategies to mitigate CV risk. The review concludes with future challenges, including the inextricable link between air pollution and climate change, and calls for large-scale trials to allow the promulgation of formal evidence-based recommendations to lower air pollution-induced health risks.

However, unpacking the contribution of different environmental stressors remains elusive in large-scale observational settings in part because of the lack of an extensive long-term network of soil moisture measurements and the common seasonal concurrence of droughts and heat waves. In this study, we link state-of-the-art land surface model data and fine-scale weather information with a long panel of county-level yields for six major US crops (1981-2017) to unpack their historical and future climatic drivers. To this end, we develop a statistical approach that flexibly characterizes the distinct intra-seasonal yield sensitivities to high-frequency fluctuations of soil moisture and temperature. In contrast with previous statistical evidence, we directly elicit an important role of water stress in explaining historical yields. However, our models project the direct effect of temperature-which we interpret as heat stress-remains the primary climatic driver of future yields under climate change.","[Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Wang, Haoying] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Business & Technol Management, Socorro, NM 87801 USA; [Carrillo, Carlos M.; Ault, Toby R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; New Mexico Institute of Mining Technology; Cornell University,"Ortiz-Bobea, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ao332@cornell.edu,"Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel/V-5938-2019","Wang, Haoying/0000-0002-9171-7298; Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel/0000-0003-4482-6843","NSF [1360424]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State project [1011555]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State project","A O-B was supported by NSF grant 1360424 and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multi State project 1011555.",,38,58,60,8,37,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Nevertheless, the hydroclimate changes projected by the state-of-the-art earth system models across the island remain unknown. Here, we assess 21st-century changes in hydroclimate over Hispaniola Island using precipitation, temperature, and surface soil moisture data from the 6th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The resulting analysis indicates, as with the previous 5th Phase of CMIP (CMIP5) models, that Hispaniola Island might see a significant drying through the 21st century. The aridity appears to be robust in most of the island following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 5-8.6, which assumes the worst case greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. We find a significant reduction in both annual mean precipitation and surface soil moisture (soil's upper 10 cm), although it appears to be more pronounced for precipitation (up to 26% and 11% for precipitation and surface soil moisture, respectively). Even though we provide insights into future hydroclimate changes on Hispaniola Island, CMIP6's intrinsic uncertainties and native horizontal resolution precludes us to better assess these changes at local scales. As such, we consider future dynamical downscaling efforts that might help us to better inform policy-makers and stakeholders in terms of drought risk.","[Herrera, Dimitris A.] Univ Autonoma Santo Domingo, Inst Geog Univ, Santo Domingo 10103, Dominican Rep; [Mendez-Tejeda, Rafael] Univ Puerto Rico, Res Lab Atmospher Sci, Carolina, PR 00984 USA; [Centella-Artola, Abel; Martinez-Castro, Daniel] Inst Meteorol, Havana 11700, Cuba; [Ault, Toby] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Delanoy, Ramon] Univ Autonoma Santo Domingo, Inst Fis, Fac Ciencias, Santo Domingo 51122, Dominican Rep",Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo; University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico at Carolina; Cornell University; Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo,"Herrera, DA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Santo Domingo, Inst Geog Univ, Santo Domingo 10103, Dominican Rep.",dherrera88@uasd.edu.do; rafael.mendez@upr.edu; abelcentella@gmail.com; danielmartinezc53@gmail.com; toby.ault@cornell.edu; radelanoy@gmail.com,"Centella, Abel/AAA-6631-2021","Martinez-Castro, Daniel/0000-0002-5957-4637; Centella, Abel/0000-0002-1536-6043; Herrera, Dimitris A./0000-0003-2361-5844","Dominican Republic Ministry of Higher Education (MESCyT), through the Fondo Nacional de Innovacion y Desarrollo Cientifico y Tenologico (FONDOCYT) Grant [2018-2019-1C3-137]","Dominican Republic Ministry of Higher Education (MESCyT), through the Fondo Nacional de Innovacion y Desarrollo Cientifico y Tenologico (FONDOCYT) Grant","This work was fully funded by the Dominican Republic Ministry of Higher Education (MESCyT), through the Fondo Nacional de Innovacion y Desarrollo Cientifico y Tenologico (FONDOCYT) Grant, No. 2018-2019-1C3-137.",,52,2,2,11,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,JAN,2021,1,,,,,,6,10.3390/atmos12010006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12010006,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,PV1MY,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000609759400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The state-of-the-art of the wind variability studies suggests a hypothetical reinforcement of SB at coastal stations. We first developed a robust automated method for the identification of SB days. Then, by using homogenized wind observations from 16 stations across Eastern Spain, we identified 9,349 episodes for analyzing the multidecadal variability and trends in SB speeds, gusts and occurrence for 1961-2019. The major finding is the opposite trends and decoupled variability of SB speeds and gusts: the SB speeds declined significantly in all seasons (except for winter), and the SB gusts strengthened at the annual scale and in autumn-winter, being most significant in autumn. Our results also show that the SB occurrence has increased across most of Eastern Spain, although presenting contrasting seasonal trends: positive in winter and negative in summer. We found that more frequent anticyclonic conditions, NAOI + and MOI + are positively linked to the increased winter occurrence; however, the causes behind the opposite trends in SB speeds and gusts remain unclear. The SB changes are complex to explain, involving both large-scale circulation and physical-local factors that challenge the understanding of the opposite trends. Further investigation is needed to assess whether these trends are a widespread phenomenon, while climate models could simulate the drivers behind these decoupled SB changes in a warmer climate.","[Bedoya-Valestt, Shalenys; Azorin-Molina, Cesar] Consejo Super Invest Cient CIDE, CSIC UV Generalitat Valenciana, Ctr Invest Desertificac, Climate Atmosphere & Ocean Lab Climatoc Lab, Valencia, Spain; [Gimeno, Luis] Univ Vigo, Ctr Invest Marina, Environm Phys Lab EPhysLab, Orense, Spain; [Guijarro, Jose A.] State Meteorol Agcy AEMET, Balearic Isl Off, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Sanchez-Morcillo, Victor J.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Invest Gest Integrada Zonas Costeras, Valencia, Spain; [Aguilar, Enric; Brunet, Manola] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Ctr Climate Change, Tarragona, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); Universidade de Vigo; Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Bedoya-Valestt, S (corresponding author), Consejo Super Invest Cient CIDE, CSIC UV Generalitat Valenciana, Ctr Invest Desertificac, Climate Atmosphere & Ocean Lab Climatoc Lab, Valencia, Spain.",shalenys.bedoya@csic.es,"Azorin-Molina, Cesar/ABB-5381-2021; Manola, Brunet-India/E-8239-2010; Guijarro, Jose/L-3744-2014; Azorin-Molina, Cesar/A-9510-2012","Manola, Brunet-India/0000-0002-9386-710X; Guijarro, Jose/0000-0002-9527-9758; Azorin-Molina, Cesar/0000-0001-5913-7026; GIMENO, LUIS/0000-0002-0778-3605","CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature; IBER-STILLING (MCIU/AEI/FEDER,UE) [RTI2018-095749-A-I00]; VENTS [GVA-AICO/2021/023]; Ramon y Cajal fellowship [RYC-2017-22830]; 2021 Leonardo Grant for Researchers and Cultural Creators, BBVA Foundation","CRUE-CSIC; Springer Nature; IBER-STILLING (MCIU/AEI/FEDER,UE); VENTS; Ramon y Cajal fellowship(Spanish Government); 2021 Leonardo Grant for Researchers and Cultural Creators, BBVA Foundation","Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

For each station, we inferred the true long-term P using a Budyko curve, which is an empirical equation relating long-term P, Q, and potential evaporation. We subsequently calculated long-term bias correction factors for three state-of-the-art P climatologies [the WorldClim version 2 database (WorldClim V2); Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas, version 1.2 (CHELSA V1.2 ); and Climate Hazards Group Precipitation Climatology, version 1 (CHPclim V1)], after which we used random-forest regression to produce global gap-free bias correction maps for the P climatologies. Monthly climatological bias correction factors were calculated by disaggregating the long-term bias correction factors on the basis of gauge catch efficiencies. We found that all three climatologies systematically underestimate P over parts of all major mountain ranges globally, despite the explicit consideration of orography in the production of each climatology. In addition, all climatologies underestimate P at latitudes >60 degrees N, likely because of gauge undercatch. Exceptionally high long-term correction factors (>1.5) were obtained for all three P climatologies in Alaska, High Mountain Asia, and Chile-regions characterized by marked elevation gradients, sparse gauge networks, and significant snowfall. Using the bias-corrected WorldClim V2, we demonstrated that other widely used P datasets (GPCC V2015, GPCP V2.3, and MERRA-2) severely underestimate P over Chile, the Himalayas, and along the Pacific coast of North America. Mean P for the global land surface based on the bias-corrected WorldClim V2 is 862 mm yr(-1) (a 9.4% increase over the original WorldClim V2). The annual and monthly bias-corrected P climatologies have been released as the Precipitation Bias Correction (PBCOR) dataset, which is available online ().","[Beck, Hylke E.; Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [McVicar, Tim R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [McVicar, Tim R.] Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio] Univ La Frontera, Dept Civil Engn, Temuco, Chile; [Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio; Alvarez-Garreton, Camila] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res, Santiago, Chile; [Alvarez-Garreton, Camila] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Conservat Biodivers & Terr, Valdivia, Chile; [Baez-Villanueva, Oscar M.] Technol Arts Sci TH Koln, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Cologne, Germany; [Baez-Villanueva, Oscar M.] TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Spatial Planning, Dortmund, Germany; [Sheffield, Justin] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Karger, Dirk N.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Princeton University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad Austral de Chile; Dortmund University of Technology; University of Southampton; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Beck, HE (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",hylke.beck@gmail.com,"Baez-Villanueva, Oscar Manuel/ABG-1929-2020; McVicar, Tim R/D-8614-2011; Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio/C-7855-2012; Karger, Dirk Nikolaus/ABD-5181-2021; Beck, Hylke/ABD-9012-2020","McVicar, Tim R/0000-0002-0877-8285; Zambrano-Bigiarini, Mauricio/0000-0002-9536-643X; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM), under UNESCO; Chilean Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2) [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110009]","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM), under UNESCO; Chilean Center for Climate and Resilience Research (CR2)","Hylke Beck was supported in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM), under the auspices of UNESCO.

The model is built on simple cause-effect relationships between environmental drivers and biodiversity impacts, based on state-of-the-art knowledge. The mean abundance of original species relative to their abundance in undisturbed ecosystems (MSA) is used as the indicator for biodiversity. Changes in drivers are derived from the IMAGE 2.4 model. Drivers considered are land-cover change, land-use intensity, fragmentation, climate change, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and infrastructure development. GLOBIO3 addresses (i) the impacts of environmental drivers on MSA and their relative importance; (ii) expected trends under various future scenarios; and (iii) the likely effects of various policy response options. GLOBIO3 has been used successfully in several integrated regional and global assessments. Three different global-scale policy options have been evaluated on their potential to reduce MSA loss. These options are: climate-change mitigation through expanded use of bio-energy, an increase in plantation forestry, and an increase in protected areas. We conclude that MSA loss is likely to continue during the coming decades. Plantation forestry may help to reduce the rate of loss, whereas climate-change mitigation through the extensive use of bioenergy crops will, in fact, increase this rate of loss. The protection of 20% of all large ecosystems leads to a small reduction in the rate of loss, provided that protection is effective and that currently degraded protected areas are restored.","[Alkemade, Rob; van Oorschot, Mark; Bakkenes, Michel; ten Brink, Ben] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Miles, Lera] UNEP, World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, Cambridge CB3 0DL, Cambs, England; [Nellemann, Christian] NINA, GRID Arendal, UNEP, N-2624 Lillehammer, Norway",Norwegian Institute Nature Research,"Alkemade, R (corresponding author), Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, POB 303, NL-3720 AH Bilthoven, Netherlands.",rob.alkemade@pbl.nl,"Miles, Lera/C-7334-2009; Alkemade, Rob/U-3663-2017","Miles, Lera/0000-0003-0377-5904; Alkemade, Rob/0000-0001-8761-1768",,,,,66,313,328,14,136,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2009,3,,,,374,390,,10.1007/s10021-009-9229-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-009-9229-5,,,17,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,424EC,,hybrid,,,12/21/22,WOS:000264547300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our glacier history is derived from the SVALHOLA database, the first compilation of Holocene geochronology for Svalbard and the surrounding waters, including over 1,800 radiocarbon, terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide and optically stimulated luminescence ages. Data have been categorized by geological setting, uniformly (re-)calibrated, quality assessed and ultimately used to constrain glacier fluctuations (deglaciation, ice free conditions, glacier re-advances and ice marginal positions). We advance existing knowledge by mapping the extent and distribution of ice-cover during the Holocene glacial maximum and the glacial minimum, as well as present retreat rates (and percentages) within Early Holocene fjord-systems. Throughout the Holocene, Svalbard glaciers have responded to a varying combination of climatic, environmental and dynamic driving factors which influence both the extent and behavior of ice margins. We discuss the complexities of glacier systems and their dynamics in response to changes in climate. This review provides a holistic state of the art of Holocene glaciers on Svalbard, suitable for orienting future works which address gaps in our current knowledge.","[Farnsworth, Wesley R.; Noormets, Riko; Retelle, Michael] Univ Ctr Svalbard UNIS, Dept Arctic Geol, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway; [Farnsworth, Wesley R.; Allaart, Lis; Alexanderson, Helena; Forwick, Matthias; Schomacker, Anders] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Geosci, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Farnsworth, Wesley R.] Univ Iceland, Nordic Volcanol Ctr, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ingolfsson, Olafur] Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Alexanderson, Helena] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Retelle, Michael] Bates Coll, Dept Geol, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",University Centre Svalbard (UNIS); UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Iceland; University of Iceland; Lund University,"Farnsworth, WR (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Nord Volcanol Ctr, NordVulk, Sturlugata 7, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",wesleyf@hi.is,"Schomacker, Anders/I-6569-2019; Farnsworth, Wesley/AAO-5572-2021","Schomacker, Anders/0000-0002-8031-9008; Farnsworth, Wesley/0000-0001-7375-2228; Noormets, Riko/0000-0002-2832-386X; Allaart, Lis/0000-0002-4664-7657",Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund [16/35]; Carlsberg Foundation [CF14-0756]; University Center in Svalbard (UNIS); Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Norway [2017-ARS79772]; Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland [2017-ARS79772],Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund; Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); University Center in Svalbard (UNIS); Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Norway; Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland,"Fianancial support has been provided by the Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund (16/35; to WRF), the Carlsberg Foundation (CF14-0756 to AS), The University Center in Svalbard (UNIS) (research grant to OI), and Arctic Research and Studies funded by the Ministries for Foreign Affairs of Norway and Iceland (2017-ARS79772 to AS & WRF).

They both present models of intricate interconnectedness of human bodies and their non-human environments, but they differ in emphasis and orientation. One is a self-conscious landscape performance art event and the other highlights the affective co-constitution of earth and humans. The two projects presented in Ilija Trojanow's novel EisTau represent two radically different ways of narrating and artistically configuring interconnectedness of bodies and environment. The performance event seeks to highlight the role of the human as driver for creative solutions in a global age. The scientist who suffers from sadness and melancholy, on the other hand, reacts by channelling his affective disorder into destructive-and, in the end, self-destructive-actions. By presenting both sides, Trojanow offers the reader a chance to negotiate the tension between a focus on the critique of dominant narratives and the dire need for people to be involved in helping shape better futures in new and creative ways.",,,,,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1573-2193,,978-90-04-33474-8; 978-90-04-32875-4,CONSCIOUS LITER ART,,,2017,,,,,174,189,,10.1163/9789004334748_013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004334748_013,,,16,Literary Theory & Criticism; Literature,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Literature,BH9CW,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000403893700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the suitability of tree-ring chronologies to reflect the true spectral properties of past changes in temperature and hydroclimate has recently been debated. At issue is the accurate quantification of temperature differences between early nineteenth-century cooling and recent warming. In this regard, central Europe (CEU) offers the unique opportunity to compare evidence from instrumental measurements, paleomodel simulations, and proxy reconstructions covering both the exceptionally hot summer of 2003 and the year without summer in 1816. This study uses 565 Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) ring width samples from high-elevation sites in the Slovakian Tatra Mountains and Austrian Alps to reconstruct CEU summer temperatures over the past three centuries. This new temperature history is compared to different sets of instrumental measurements and state-of-the-art climate model simulations. All records independently reveal the coolest conditions in the 1810s and warmest after 1996, but the ring width-based reconstruction overestimates the intensity and duration of the early nineteenth-century summer cooling by approximately 1.5 degrees C at decadal scales. This proxy-specific deviation is most likely triggered by inflated biological memory in response to reduced warm season temperature, together with changes in radiation and precipitation following the Tambora eruption in April 1815. While suggesting there exists a specific limitation in ring width chronologies to capture abrupt climate perturbations with increased climate system inertia, the results underline the importance of alternative dendrochronological and wood anatomical parameters, including stable isotopes and maximum density, to assess the frequency and severity of climatic extremes.","[Buentgen, Ulf; Hellmann, Lena; Nievergelt, Daniel] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf; Broennimann, Stefan; Hellmann, Lena] Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf; Trnka, Miroslav; Kyncl, Tomas; Stepanek, Petr] Global Change Res Ctr AS CR Vvi, Brno, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Inst Agr Syst & Bioclimatol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Krusic, Paul J.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Krusic, Paul J.] Navarino Environm Observ, Messinia, Greece; [Kyncl, Tomas; Kyncl, Josef] Moravian Dendro Labor, Brno, Czech Republic; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Zorita, Eduardo] Helmholtz Zentrum, Inst Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier] Stockholm Univ, Dept Hist, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Auer, Ingeborg] Cent Inst Meteorol & Geodynam ZAMG, Vienna, Austria; [Konter, Oliver; Schneider, Lea; Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55122 Mainz, Germany; [Tegel, Willy] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Growth IWW, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Bern; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Mendel University in Brno; Stockholm University; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht - Zentrum fur Material- und Kustenforschung; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; University of Freiburg","Buntgen, U (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",buentgen@wsl.ch,"Trnka, Miroslav/F-9428-2014; Charpentier Ljungqvist, Fredrik/I-5770-2012; Stepanek, Petr/G-1614-2014; Nievergelt, Daniel/J-7156-2012; Tegel, Willy/M-8187-2014; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013","Trnka, Miroslav/0000-0003-4727-8379; Charpentier Ljungqvist, Fredrik/0000-0003-0220-3947; Stepanek, Petr/0000-0001-8956-5590; Nievergelt, Daniel/0000-0003-0402-9348; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Tegel, Willy/0000-0003-4707-2848; Bronnimann, Stefan/0000-0001-9502-7991; Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973; Schneider, Lea/0000-0002-8208-7300",Czech project Building up a multidisciplinary scientific team focused on drought [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0248]; Eva Mayr-Stihl Foundation; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P209/11/0956],Czech project Building up a multidisciplinary scientific team focused on drought; Eva Mayr-Stihl Foundation; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"K.

The term 'safe and friendly school climate' here reffers to a peaceful atmosphere where the teachers, staff, and students are free from all fear and dangers (BNPB, 2011). In other words, a safe and friendly school refers to educational institution in which all the members (teachers, staff, and students) are free from dangers both internally and externally (Kemendikbud, 2016). In order to have 'a safe and friendly school' for all, the following efforts should be taken seriously into mind: (a) teachers should have adequate competences, both personal, pedagogyc, professional, and social; (b) there is need for building up a communication forum (e.g. PGRI, MKKS, MGMP, KKG, IGTK) for all stakeholders to communicate and to help each other in resolving the problems; and (c) there is also a need to develop local-wisdom based management in order to have a character and harmonious school.","[Agung, Anak Agung Gede] Ganesha Educ Univ, Educ Management, Denpasar, Indonesia",Ganesha University of Education,"Agung, AAG (corresponding author), Ganesha Educ Univ, Educ Management, Denpasar, Indonesia.",agung2056@undiksha.ac.id,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-419-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,,,,,1065,1070,,,,,,6,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BJ6IQ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000426717800173,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Transformation Matrix were employed to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of land cover and vegetation impacted by changes in climate. The result reflects that the trend of average annual temperature was remarkably increased (phi = 0.12, Z = 0.75) in the 36-year period, and the temperature was increased by 0.5 degrees C, although precipitation had slightly decreased during the same period. In the thirteen years' period, forest land and water resource decreased by 3429.62 km(2) and 81.45 km(2), respectively. In contrast, an increment was observed in grassland (2779.33 km(2)), cultivated land (535.34 km(2)), bare land (43.08 km(2)), urban land (0.65 km(2)), and wetland (152.66 km(2)) in the same period. In the study, it was also observed a decrease of an NDVI value by 0.1 was observed in 2013 in the southern part of the basin. The findings of the present study illustrate a significant change in eco-hydrological conditions in the ARB with an adverse impact on the environment. Hydroclimatic changes caused the increase in temperature and decreasing trend in precipitation which significantly impacted the land cover and vegetation in the basin. The changes in land cover were mostly caused by global and local climate influence which mainly affects the hydroclimate and eco-hydrology systems of the basin. The result is consistent with that of the previous studies conducted elsewhere. The findings of this paper could help researchers to understand the eco-hydrological condition of the study basin and become a foundation for further studies.","[Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu; Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Song, Xinshan; Girma, Abel; Gedefaw, Mohammed] Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Qin, Tianlin] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Qin, Tianlin] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, Water Resources Dept, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Kassa, Mulualem T.] Biotaq Econ Innovat BioTEI Inc, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Girma, Abel; Gedefaw, Mohammed] Univ Gondar, Dept Nat Resource Management, Gondar 196, Ethiopia; [Dorjsuren, Batsuren] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Environm & Forest Engn, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Wang, Hejia] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yadamjav, Otgonbayar] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Ulan Bator 210646, Mongolia",Donghua University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; University of Gondar; National University of Mongolia; Tsinghua University; National University of Mongolia,"Yan, DH (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, Water Resources Dept, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",yandh@iwhr.com,"Dorjsuren, Batsuren/Q-6986-2018; Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/AFV-4937-2022","Dorjsuren, Batsuren/0000-0002-7864-8291; Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/0000-0002-2412-1507","China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research; National Key Research and Development Project, China [2016YFA0601503]","China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research; National Key Research and Development Project, China","The authors would like to thank the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research for financing this research and Donghua University.

Overall, the large-scale patterns of both the climatology of the annual precipitation amount and the seasonality are consistent between the two observations. Nevertheless, some noticeable differences existed, particularly in the regions with fewer gauge observations, such as northern Africa and the Tibetan Plateau. For long-term changes, significant drying trends during 1948-2005 were observed in the tropical areas of northern Africa, accompanied by significant wetting trends in the polar region of Canada. The seasonality change during the period was dominated by a decreasing trend in precipitation, especially in the western portion of Russia. The model simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) reproduced the climatological mean state of annual precipitation and its seasonality in the observations, as well as to some extent the zonal mean trends of precipitation amounts, but did not reproduce the zonal mean trends of seasonality. The two-dimensional distribution of linear trends of annual precipitation and seasonality simulated by CMIP5 models showed little consistency with their observational counterparts. One possibility for the inconsistencies was that they were largely determined by internal variations of the climate system rather than external forcings. In contrast, it might also suggest a challenge for state-of-the-art climate models to correctly simulate the spatial distribution of responses of annual precipitation amounts and seasonality to the evolution of external forcings. Our results suggest that, in addition to the precipitation amount, seasonality should be used as a metric to assess the ability of a climate model to simulate current climate conditions and project future climate change.","[Li, Xiaofan] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zeng-Zhen; Zhu, Jieshun; Jha, Bhaskar] NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, NCEP, NWS, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Jiang, Xingwen; Li, Yueqing] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Plateau Meteorol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zongting] Inst Meteorol Sci Jilin Prov, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zongting] Lab Res Middle High Latitude Circulat & East Asia, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Yang, Song] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jieshun; Jha, Bhaskar] Innovim LLC, Greenbelt, MD USA",Zhejiang University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; China Meteorological Administration; Sun Yat Sen University,"Hu, ZZ (corresponding author), NOAA, Climate Predict Ctr, NCEP, NWS, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",zeng-zhen.hu@noaa.gov,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011; Li, Xiaofan/G-2094-2014; Gao, Zongting/N-3649-2013","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91337107, 41375081, 41475039]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the reviewers for their constructive suggestions, which led to a significant improvement of the paper quality.

At the Rietholzbach research catchment in northeastern Switzerland, two weighing lysimeters are in operation. One is a recently installed state-of-the-art monolithic mini-lysimeter with a tension-controlled lower boundary; the other is a large backfilled free-drainage lysimeter in operation since 1976. For this study, the mini-lysimeter measurements were processed using the Adaptive-Window and Adaptive-Threshold (AWAT) filter. The resulting water-balance estimates were then compared with those of the lower resolution large lysimeter, whose processing has remained unchanged since its installation. A number of additional, retrospectively applicable processing steps for the large lysimeter were then tested to mitigate the main sources of error for this instrument. Those found to be most beneficial were the application of a 10-min moving average to the mass measurements and the setting of ET and condensation to zero in hours with liquid precipitation. In spite of the differences in design, a generally close agreement between the two lysimeters was observed, which was further improved with the optimized large-lysimeter processing. A comparison of the lysimeter mass increases associated with liquid precipitation further revealed, however, that the large lysimeter experiences a previously unknown under-catch of about 11.5%, which could also be important for other lysimeter facilities. This under-catch led to a reduction in large-lysimeter seepage during the analyzed period, although the ET flux was not found to be affected.","[Ruth, Conall E.; Michel, Dominik; Hirschi, Martin; Seneviratne, Sonia, I] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Ruth, CE; Michel, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",conall.eoin@alumni.ethz.ch; dominik.michael@env.ethz.ch,"Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Hirschi, Martin/ABF-1564-2020","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Hirschi, Martin/0000-0001-9154-756X; Ruth, Conall E./0000-0003-2129-6798",,,,,27,7,7,3,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,1539-1663,,VADOSE ZONE J,Vadose Zone J.,17-May,2018,1,,,,,,170026,10.2136/vzj2017.01.0026,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2017.01.0026,,,10,Environmental Sciences; Soil Science; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture; Water Resources,GO1FY,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000439696300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show that the surface roughness lengths for heat and moisture over uninterrupted sea ice vary with roughness Reynolds number (R*; itself a function of the roughness length for momentum, z0, and surface wind stress), with a peak at the transition between aerodynamically smooth (R*<0.135) and aerodynamically rough (R*>2.5) regimes. A pre-existing theoretical model based on surface-renewal theory accurately reproduces this peak, in contrast to the simple parameterizations currently employed in two state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models, which are insensitive to R*. We propose a new, simple parameterization for surface exchange over the MIZ that blends this theoretical model for sea ice with surface exchange over water as a function of sea ice concentration. In offline tests, this new scheme performs much better than the existing schemes for the rough conditions observed during the 'Iceland Greenland Seas Project' field campaign. The bias in total turbulent heat flux across the MIZ is reduced to only 13 W m(-2) for the new scheme, from 48 and 80 W m(-2) for the Met Office Unified Model and ECMWF Integrated Forecast System schemes, respectively. It also performs marginally better for the comparatively smooth conditions observed during the 'Aerosol-Cloud Coupling and Climate Interactions in the Arctic' field campaign. The new surface exchange scheme has the benefit of being physically-motivated, comparatively accurate and straightforward to implement, although to reap the full benefits an improvement to the representation of sea ice topography via z0 is required.","[Elvidge, A.

Its potential of expanding and transmitting Schistosoma mansoni is of great concern. We seek to map S. mansoni transmission potential by predicting ecological dimensions and potential distributions of B. straminea using state-of-the-art ecological niche model approaches. Two environmental datasets were selected to fit individual and ensemble niche models, together with the evaluation of niche conservatism during B. straminea invasion in China. A small area is still occupied by the introduced population compared to that in Brazil. A vast space with suitable climate remains unfilled and might be available to B. straminea. Contrasting results of niche conservatism evaluation were attained based on the two environmental datasets.

To provide suitable housing in a historical building for a museum, these buildings are usually adapted to suit the need for object preservation through HVAC control. Maintaining a strict indoor climate and limiting short fluctuations in indoor temperature and indoor relative humidity reduces risk on objects. However, this also results in a rather high energy demand and therefore rather high costs. Previous research showed the energy conservation possibilities for a museum with state-of-the-art building envelope by adapting setpoint strategies. A gap in literature is present in applying these strategies in historical museum buildings. The aim of this study is to make use of different setpoint strategies to provide an indication of possible energy conservation for a historical museum building with respect to object preservation and thermal comfort. The method used consists of a measurement campaign to establish the current indoor climate and a simulation study with different climate control strategies. The simulation study provides possibilities to assess energy efficient control strategies with preservation of valuable museum objects in mind. The Amsterdam Museum serves as a case study during this research. With the data obtained during the measurement campaign, a hygrothermal zone-simulation model was calibrated. The results of the different climate control strategies present the energy saving potential for historical museum buildings. It is concluded that using the adaptive thermal comfort guideline for temperature during opening hours, and letting the collection criteria developed by ASHRAE's climate classes determine the relative humidity during the day, can save up to approximately 15% for a historical museum building without increasing the risk to the collection.

The scholarly debate is, however, highly fragmented, complicating the production of cumulative insights. To address this knowledge gap, we used six governance strategies for achieving flood resilience that previously have been put forward as a conceptual framework to review 121 articles published between 2016 and 2019, complemented with insights contained in recent overview articles, to gauge the state-of-the-art in FRG literature: to (a) diversify flood risk management strategies; (b) align the strategies; (c) adequately involve private actors, including citizens; (d) put an adequate rule system in place; (e) cater for sufficient monetary and non-monetary resources; (f) inspire an open and inclusive normative debate. We found, first, that literature is producing insights on increasingly technically advanced risk assessments and agent-based models but societal debate on justice in flood risk governance is getting attention. A clearly emerging topic is that of citizen engagement in flood risk governance. Second, the geographical focus of the studies is still skewed toward the Global North. To make progress in understanding flood risk governance for better resilience more systematic and comparative empirical assessments of flood risk governance in order to derive generalizable lessons while better taking into account the context-specificity of FRG. Testing flood risk governance solutions against comparative cases, by balancing the geographical scope of research efforts, and enhancing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary working is a way to deliver knowledge for more resilience.","[Matczak, Piotr] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Sociol, Szamarzewskiego 89 C, PL-61712 Poznan, Wielkopolskie, Poland; [Hegger, Dries] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands",Adam Mickiewicz University; Utrecht University,"Matczak, P (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Sociol, Szamarzewskiego 89 C, PL-61712 Poznan, Wielkopolskie, Poland.",matczak@amu.edu.pl,"; Hegger, Dries/L-9301-2013","Matczak, Piotr/0000-0002-8638-0141; Hegger, Dries/0000-0003-2721-3527",,,,,155,8,8,7,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2049-1948,,,WIRES WATER,Wiley Interdiscip.

The authors contend that such a problem has an enduring quality that leads to a highly problematic state of learning organization, and a radical shift in the understanding is necessary. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a critical review of relevant literature in the areas of learning organization. Some of Senge's own works will also be reviewed. Findings This paper contends that Senge's project of learning organization is a managerial attempt to remove bureaucracy and, as such, the concept of learning has been displaced from the outset. Hence, the theory of learning organization offers a weak response to the pressing issues such as climate and global warming. While some of Senge's other works seem to show an awareness of the necessity of new managerial visions, the authors argue that what is required is a scrutiny of the belief that corporations are able to achieve a wider social and ecological goal. Originality/value This paper offers a radical account of Senge's concept of learning organization, including Senge's dialogue with Nan Huai-Jin, published in Chinese. The authors question the mysterious state of learning in Senge's learning organization and offer a possible new account of learning organization.","[Hsu, Shih-Wei; Lamb, Peter] Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, Ningbo, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham Ningbo China,"Hsu, SW (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Business Sch China, Ningbo, Peoples R China.",shih-wei.hsu@nottingham.edu.cn; Peter.lamb@nottingham.edu.cn,,,,,,,50,7,7,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-6474,1758-7905,,LEARN ORGAN,Learn.

The spatial resolution of the new ocean model is 3A degrees in latitude and 5A degrees in longitude, with 25 unevenly spaced vertical levels. In the previous version of the oceanic model, as in the atmospheric model, the horizontal resolution was 4.5A degrees in latitude and 6A degrees in longitude, with four vertical levels (the upper quasi-homogeneous layer, seasonal thermocline, abyssal ocean, and bottom friction layer). There is no correction for the heat and momentum fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean in the new version of the IAP RAS CM. Numerical experiments with the IAP RAS CM have been performed under current initial and boundary conditions, as well as with an increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The main simulated atmospheric and oceanic fields agree quite well with observational data. The new version's equilibrium temperature sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 doubling was found to be 2.9 K.

Increased temperatures have a tremendous effect on the energy demand for cooling, with a great impact on peak and total electricity demand. Renewable technologies in the urban environment have been widely regarded as an increasingly important solution to deal with the climate change challenges and energy security. Significant effort is performed in the integration of photovoltaic panels (PV) and micro turbines in the urban context showing a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions. At the same time attention is drawn to an often-overlooked aspect regarding renewable energy technologies, in that despite having low operating costs their overall benefits are often not well understood and consequently are often evaluated as being less profitable than fossil fuel alternatives, even though they are future proof about energy cost. The aim of the present paper is to describe the role of renewable energy technologies and zero carbon technologies in covering the future increased energy demand for cooling. The integration of photovoltaics in the urban environment through PV facades, pavements, and shading devices are discussed. The role of Information and Computer Technology and smart grids in the efficient management of renewables in urban scale is discussed. The role of smart metering, users 'integration and demand response capabilities for future zero energy urban neighborhoods is revealed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among these factors are the external factors of human (anthropogenic) activity, volcanoes and putative variations in the irradiance of the sun, and the internal factor of natural variability. Here, by using a simple climate/ocean model to simulate the observed temperature changes for different state-of-the-art radiative-forcing models, we present strong evidence that while the anthropogenic effect has steadily increased in size during the entire 20th century such that it presently is the dominant external forcing of the climate system, there is a residual factor at work within the climate system, whether a natural oscillation or something else as yet unknown. This has an important implication for our expectation of future temperature changes.","Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Climate Res Grp, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Andronova, NG (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Climate Res Grp, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",natasha@atmos.uiuc.edu; schlesin@atmos.uiuc.edu,"Andronova, Natalia/I-8983-2012",,,,,,29,83,88,0,18,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

An important requirement for this mechanism is that multiple sea-ice extents exist under the same land ice configuration. This hypothesis of multiple sea-ice extents is tested with a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model coupled to an atmospheric energy-moisture-balance model. The model includes a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice module, has a realistic ocean configuration and bathymetry, and is forced by annual mean forcing. Several runs with two different land ice distributions represent present-day and cold-climate conditions. In each case the ocean model is initiated with both ice-free and fully ice-covered states. We find that the present-day runs converge approximately to the same sea-ice state for the northern hemisphere while for the southern hemisphere a difference in sea-ice extent of about three degrees in latitude between the different runs is observed. The cold climate runs lead to meridional sea-ice extents that are different by up to four degrees in latitude in both hemispheres. While approaching the final states, the model exhibits abrupt transitions from extended sea-ice states and weak meridional overturning circulation, to less extended sea ice and stronger meridional overturning circulation, and vice versa. These transitions are linked to temperature changes in the North Atlantic high-latitude deep water. Such abrupt changes may be associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events, as proposed by previous studies. Although multiple sea ice states have been observed, the difference between these states is not large enough to provide a strong support for the sea-ice-switch mechanism.","[Ashkenazy, Yosef; Mirzayof, Dror] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, BIDR, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Losch, Martin] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Gildor, Hezi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fredy & Nadine Herrmann Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Tziperman, Eli] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tziperman, Eli] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Ben Gurion University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Harvard University; Harvard University","Ashkenazy, Y (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, BIDR, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",ashkena@bgu.ac.il,"Losch, Martin/S-5896-2016; Ashkenazy, Yosef/AAV-3218-2020; ASHKENAZY, YOSEF/F-1483-2012; Tziperman, Eli/A-1219-2008; Gildor, Hezi/AAZ-6602-2021","Losch, Martin/0000-0002-3824-5244; Gildor, Hezi/0000-0003-0898-6292; Ashkenazy, Yosef/0000-0001-9405-068X","Israel-US Binational Science foundation; NSF climate dynamics program [ATM-0754332, ATM-0902844]",Israel-US Binational Science foundation(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); NSF climate dynamics program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the Israel-US Binational Science foundation.

Location: Along eastern Australia and into the Tasman Sea including Lord Howe Island (LHI). Time period: A contemporary scenario (2006-2015) and future business as usual RCP 8.5 climate change scenario (2090-2100). Major taxa studied: The tropical sea urchin,Tripneustes gratilla,and the temperate kelp,Ecklonia radiata. Methods: We combined mechanistic models to create a predictive map ofEckloniaandTripneustesdistributions, and their future potential to co-occur. We use 3D velocity and temperature fields produced with a state-of-the-art configuration of the Ocean Forecasting Model version 3 that simulates the contemporary oceanic environment and projects it under an RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. We map the contemporary and futureEcklonia's realized and fundamental thermal niche; and simulateTripneusteslarval dispersal under both climate scenarios. Results: Based on the thermal affinity of kelp and increases in projected temperatures, we predict a poleward range contraction of similar to 530 km by 2100 for kelp on Australia's east coast. Climate-driven changes in dispersal ofTripneusteslead to its range expansion into Bass Strait and poleward, similar to 340-650 km further intoEcklonia's habitat range inducing new areas of co-occurrence in the future.We find warming decreases spawning and settlement ofTripneustesin the tropics by 43%, and causes significant connectivity changes for LHI with future reliance on self-recruitment. Major conclusions: We predict novel regions of co-occurrence between a temperateEckloniaand tropicalTripneustesspecies which may lead to greater loss of kelp. Our results provide a new modelling approach for predicting species range shifts that is transferable to other marine ecosystems; it considers species response to abiotic change, predicts spatial spread and anticipates new regions for species interactions.","[Castro, Louise C.; Cetina-Heredia, Paulina; Roughan, Moninya; Verges, Adriana] UNSW Sydney, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Castro, Louise C.; Verges, Adriana] UNSW Sydney, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Castro, Louise C.; Cetina-Heredia, Paulina; Roughan, Moninya] UNSW Sydney, Coastal & Reg Oceanog Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dworjanyn, Symon] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Dworjanyn, Symon] Southern Cross Univ, Ctr Coastal Biogeochem Res, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Thibaut, Loic] UNSW Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chamberlain, Matthew A.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Feng, Ming] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Floreat, WA, Australia; [Verges, Adriana] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Castro, LC (corresponding author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",l.castro@unswalumni.com,"Roughan, Moninya/B-5563-2009; Feng, Ming/F-5411-2010; Thibaut, Loic/G-4284-2011; Verges, Adriana/B-8288-2013; dworjanyn, symon/O-5633-2017","Roughan, Moninya/0000-0003-3825-7533; Feng, Ming/0000-0002-2855-7092; Thibaut, Loic/0000-0003-3813-682X; Verges, Adriana/0000-0002-3507-1234; dworjanyn, symon/0000-0002-6690-8033","Australian Research Council [DP170100023, LP150100064, LP16100162, DP190102030]; NSW Environmental Trust",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); NSW Environmental Trust,"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP170100023, LP150100064, LP16100162 and DP190102030; NSW Environmental Trust",,80,9,9,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Thus, considerable progress has been made toward understanding these short-term cooling events in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and North America. However, few relevant studies have been conducted in coastal East Asia due to a lack of undisturbed sample materials appropriate for paleoclimate studies. In this study, we examined Holocene abrupt drying events and the Holocene climate optimum (HCO) based on a new high-resolution multi-proxy record (pollen, mean grain size, total organic carbon, carbon/ nitrogen ratio) from the south coast of Korea. Possible cultural impacts of the events were also explored using summed probability distributions (SPDs) of archaeological radiocarbon dates. Our arboreal pollen percentage (AP) data clearly indicated drying events centered at 9.8 ka, 9.2 ka, 8.2 ka, 4.7 ka, 4.2 ka, 3.7 ka, 3.2 ka, 2.8 ka, and 2.4 ka BP. The AP data also indicated that forests were severely damaged by a two-step successive drying event during the period from 8.4 ka to 8 ka BP and that the HCO lasted from ca. 7.6 ka to ca. 4.8 ka BP. According to the results of a correlation analysis, climate variations on the Korean peninsula were possibly controlled by shifts in western tropical Pacific (WTP) sea surface temperatures during the past similar to 5500 years. Simultaneous declines in the SPDs and AP from 2.8 ka to 2.3 ka BP may reflect a demographic reduction attributable to rapid climate deterioration on the peninsula. Refugee agriculturalists might have immigrated to Japan and developed the Yayoi culture. In this study, the 2.8 ka event and its societal impact are recognized clearly for the first time in coastal East Asia.","[Park, Jungjae; Park, Jinheum; Choi, Jieun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Park, Jungjae] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Korean Reg Studies, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Yi, Sangheon; Kim, Jin Cheul; Lee, Eunmi] Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Geol Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejon 34132, South Korea; [Yi, Sangheon] Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Petr Resources Technol, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Institute of Geoscience & Mineral Resources (KIGAM); University of Science & Technology (UST),"Park, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Park, J (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Korean Reg Studies, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.;Yi, S (corresponding author), Korea Inst Geosci & Mineral Resources, Geol Div, 124 Gwahak Ro, Daejon 34132, South Korea.;Yi, S (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Petr Resources Technol, 217 Gajeong Ro, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.",jungjaep@snu.ac.kr; shyi@kigam.re.kr,"Yi, Sangheon/AAE-2086-2022; Yi, Sangheon/D-4780-2011","Yi, Sangheon/0000-0002-2938-0380; Yi, Sangheon/0000-0002-2938-0380; Park, Jinheum/0000-0002-2250-8804","Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning [GP2017-013]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A2A01025813]","Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) - Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work was supported by the Basic Research Project (GP2017-013) titled Investigation of subtropicalization in the Korean Peninsula using the geological Proxy: Climate-geoecosystem assessment of the mid-Holocene period of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM), funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning.

Here we use a state-of-the-art global weather/climate modeling system with high resolution (GFDL CM4C192) to quantify this influence focusing on the U.S. extreme cold weather during winter. We perform a control simulation and the water-hosing experiment to obtain two climate states with and without a vigorous Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. We find that in the control simulation with an overturning circulation, the U.S. east of the Rockies is a region characterized by intense north-south heat exchange in the atmosphere during winter. Without the northward heat transport by the overturning circulation in the hosing experiment, this channel of atmospheric heat exchange becomes even more active through the Bjerknes compensation mechanism. Over the U.S., extreme cold weather intensifies disproportionately compared with the mean climate response after the shutdown of the overturning circulation. Our results suggest that an active overturning circulation in the present-day climate likely makes the U.S. winter less harsh and extreme. A shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation could lead to a disproportionate increase in the occurrence of extremely cold weather in the U.S. via enhanced north-south heat exchange in the atmosphere, suggest simulations with and without a vigorous overturning circulation.","[Yin, Jianjun] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Zhao, Ming] NOAA, GFDL, Princeton, NJ USA",University of Arizona; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Yin, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",yin@arizona.edu,"Zhao, Ming/C-6928-2014","Zhao, Ming/0000-0003-4996-7821",NOAA Climate Program Office [NA18OAR4310267],NOAA Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank Ron Stouffer, Zhihong Tan, and two reviewers for their comments, and ECMWF and the Copernicus Climate Change Service for providing the ERA5 reanalysis data.

Some models even simulate a complete breakdown of the THC at sufficiently strong forcing. Here results are presented from a state-of-the-art global climate model that does not simulate a weakening of the THC in response to greenhouse warming. Large-scale air-sea interactions in the Tropics, similar to those operating during present-day El Ninos, lead to anomalously high salinities in the tropical Atlantic. These are advected into the sinking region, thereby increasing the surface density and compensating the effects of the local warming and freshening.","Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Latif, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",,"Latif, Mojib/C-2428-2016","Latif, Mojib/0000-0003-1079-5604",,,,,30,191,194,1,15,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

In these contexts, having tools that facilitate efficient and rapid management of hazards-vulnerabilities is a priority for the preventive conservation and triage of cultural assets. This paper presents the first (to the authors' knowledge) free and public availability Artificial Intelligence platform designed for conservation strategies in cultural heritage. Art-Risk 3.0 is a platform designed as a fuzzy-logic inference system that combines information from geographical information system maps with expert assessments, in order to identify the contextual threat level and the degree of vulnerability that heritage buildings present. Thanks to the possibilities that the geographic information system offers, 12 Spanish churches (11th - 16th centuries) were analyzed. The artificial intelligence platform developed makes it possible to analyze the index of hazard, vulnerability and functionality, classify buildings according to the risk in order to do a sustainable use of budgets through the rational management of preventive conservation. The data stored in the system allows identify the danger due to geotechnics, precipitation, torrential downpour, thermal oscillation, frost, earthquake and flooding. Through the use of fuzzy logic, the tool interrelates environmental conditions with 14 other variables related to structural risks and the vulnerability of buildings, which are evaluated through bibliographic search and review of photographic images. The geographic information system has identified torrential rains and thermal oscillations as the environmental threats that mostly impact heritage buildings in Spain. The results obtained highlight the Church of Santiago de Jesus as the most vulnerable building due to a lack of preventive conservation programs. These results, consistent with the inclusion of this monument on the list of heritage at risk defined by Hispania Nostra, corroborate the functionality of the model. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

This study provides an overview of the state of the art in wastewater-fertigated SRC systems (wfSRCs) worldwide. Different designs, wastewater sources, tree species and varieties, planting schemes, geographic locations, and climates for wfSRC implementation were identified after conducting a literature review. The performance review includes standard water quality parameters, BOD5, COD, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, as well as the extent of pathogen and emergent contaminant removal and biomass production rates. Identified knowledge gaps and important factors to support the practical implementation of wfSRCs are highlighted. Europe leads the research of wfSRC, followed by North America and Australia. The available publications are mainly from developed countries (73%). The most applied and studied tree species in wfSRC systems are willows (32%), followed by eucalyptus (21%) and poplars (18%). Most of the reviewed studies used domestic wastewater (85%), followed by industrial wastewater (8%) and landfill leachate (7%). Most data show high BOD 5 and COD removal efficiencies (80%). There are large differences in the documented total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal efficiencies (12%-99% and 40%-80%, respectively).

Generally it is assumed that these temperature biases do not affect the projected warming in response to rising greenhouse gas concentrations (i.e. drop out by subtracting projected and present-day temperatures), but for specific regions and seasons this assumption is invalid. Here we show that, on the contrary, for large continental regions, such as Europe, state-of-the art global climate models with a warm summer bias project a relatively strong warming. This is because continental summer temperatures depend chiefly on soil drying in response to spring and summer solar radiation increase: models that dry fastest (due to the interaction of clouds, convection and soil hydrology) exhibit the strongest reductions in evaporation and consequently a more pronounced endof-summer warming. These physical mechanisms acting on a seasonal timescale also govern the longterm climate response to greenhouse forcing over continental regions in summer. Combining these findings, we use the current model biases to reduce the uncertainty range in the projected warming over Europe from 3.6-8.6 degrees C to 4.6-7.3 degrees C (a reduction of about 50%). Given the huge potential impacts of the warmest projections on health, agriculture and water management, constraining the range of future summer climate change is imperative for relevant mitigation and adaptation strategies.","[Selten, F.

This paper explores the readiness of students in Poland for open innovation (OI). The study is based on a survey of a sample of 500 students using the Computer-Assisted Web Interview research technique. The main aim of this paper is to investigate Polish students' attitude to open innovation-in particular in terms of social product development, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and the sharing economy-to assess the state-of-the-art and identify challenges. Students are selected as the target group because they are open-minded, eager to use new solutions, and will soon enter the business sector to either become the staff of companies or set up their own startups or SMEs. However, the study shows that Polish students, if they use the OI-based platforms at all, use them passively. The key barriers identified within this study are a lack of knowledge about the open innovation paradigm, its elements and opportunities, and an issue of trust. Therefore, a change of mindset, the adjustment of universities' curricula, and the development of open innovation culture are critical.","[Rosienkiewicz, Maria; Helman, Joanna; Cholewa, Mariusz; Molasy, Mateusz] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Laser Technol Automat & Prod Management, Lukasiewicza 5, PL-50371 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Rosienkiewicz, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Laser Technol Automat & Prod Management, Lukasiewicza 5, PL-50371 Wroclaw, Poland.",maria.rosienkiewicz@pwr.edu.pl; joanna.helman@pwr.edu.pl; mariusz.cholewa@pwr.edu.pl; mateusz.molasy@pwr.edu.pl,"Rosienkiewicz, Maria M./L-1637-2017","Rosienkiewicz, Maria M./0000-0002-6976-352X; Molasy, Mateusz/0000-0001-6390-9711; Cholewa, Mariusz/0000-0002-7263-4454; Helman, Joanna/0000-0002-4239-674X",Interreg Central Europe program priority Innovation and knowledge development [CE1171]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education,"Interreg Central Europe program priority Innovation and knowledge development; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","This research was funded by Interreg Central Europe program priority Innovation and knowledge development, grant number CE1171 project SYNERGY: Synergic networking for innovativeness enhancement of Central European actors focused on high-tech industry, and from funds for the science of Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education to implement an international co-financed project.",,66,2,2,7,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,1213,10.3390/su14031213,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031213,,,41,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YY8QM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000755050500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we calibrated and evaluated a semi-empirical ecosystem flux model, PREdict Light-use efficiency, Evapotranspiration and Soil water (PRELES), for various forest types and climate conditions, based on eddy covariance data from 55 sites. A Bayesian approach was adopted for model calibration and uncertainty quantification. We applied the site-specific calibrations and multisite calibrations to nine plant functional types (PFTs) to obtain the site-specific and PFT-specific parameter vectors for PRELES. A systematically designed cross-validation was implemented to evaluate calibration strategies and the risks in extrapolation. The combination of plant physiological traits and climate patterns generated significant variation in vegetation responses and model parameters across but not within PFTs, implying that applying the model without PFT-specific parameters is risky. But within PFT, the multisite calibrations performed as accurately as the site-specific calibrations in predicting gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Moreover, the variations among sites within one PFT could be effectively simulated by simply adjusting the parameter of potential light-use efficiency (LUE), implying significant convergence of simulated vegetation processes within PFT. The hierarchical modelling of PRELES provides a compromise between satellite-driven LUE and physiologically oriented approaches for extrapolating the geographical variation of ecosystem productivity. Although measurement errors of eddy covariance and remotely sensed data propagated a substantial proportion of uncertainty or potential biases, the results illustrated that PRELES could reliably capture daily variations of GPP and ET for contrasting forest types on large geographical scales if PFT-specific parameterizations were applied.","[Tian, Xianglin; Cao, Tianjian] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tian, Xianglin; Minunno, Francesco; Kalliokoski, Tuomo; Makela, Annikki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Peltoniemi, Mikko] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Kalliokoski, Tuomo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland",Northwest A&F University - China; University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Helsinki,"Cao, TJ (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",cao@nwafu.edu.cn,"Tian, Xianglin/ABG-1625-2020; Tian, Xianglin/AGX-7097-2022; makela, annikki/AAN-3996-2021; Cao, Tianjian/AAQ-8026-2020; Cao, Tianjian/GWY-2934-2022","Tian, Xianglin/0000-0001-6142-4673; Tian, Xianglin/0000-0001-6142-4673; Cao, Tianjian/0000-0001-5906-308X; Makela, Annikki/0000-0001-9633-7350; Peltoniemi, Mikko/0000-0003-2028-6969","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC 31670646]; Academy of Finland [286190]; Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [312635, 312912]; Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Program [821860]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland; Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Program,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: NSFC 31670646; Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 286190; Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 312635 and 312912; Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Framework Program, Grant/Award Number: 821860",,82,11,11,4,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Here we infer 1540 summer temperatures from the number of dry days (NDDs) in spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) in 1540 derived from historical documentary evidence published elsewhere, and compare our estimates with present-day temperatures. We translate the NDD values into temperature distributions using a linear relationship between modeled temperature and NDD from a 3000 year pre-industrial control simulation with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Our results show medium confidence that summer mean temperatures (TJJA) and maximum temperatures (TXx) in Central Europe in 1540 were warmer than the respective present-day mean summer temperatures (assessed between 1966-2015). The model-based reconstruction suggests further that with a probability of 40%-70%, the highest daily temperatures in 1540 were even warmer than in 2003, while there is at most a 20% probability that the 1540 mean summer temperature was warmer than that of 2003 in Central Europe. As with other state-of-the-art analyses, the uncertainty of the reconstructed 1540 summer weather in this study is considerable, for instance as extrapolation is required because 1540-like events are not captured by the employed Earth system model (ESM), and neither by other ESMs. However, in addition to paleoclimatological approaches we introduce here an independent methodology to estimate 1540 temperatures, and contribute consequently to a reduced overall uncertainty in the analysis of this event. The characterization of such events and the related climate system functioning is particularly relevant in the context of global warming and the corresponding increase of extreme heat wave magnitude and occurrence frequency.","[Orth, Rene; Vogel, Martha M.; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Senckenbergstr 1, D-35930 Giessen, Germany; [Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res, Senckenbergstr 3, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Pfister, Christian] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Falkenpl 16, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Justus Liebig University Giessen; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Bern,"Orth, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rene.orth@env.ethz.ch; sonia.seneviratne@ethz.ch,"Dobrovolny, Petr/F-7722-2013; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Brazdil, Rudolf/H-3156-2014; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022; Orth, Rene/AAG-7034-2021; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022","Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [607085]; European Research Council (ERC) [617518],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank Nico Kroner and Randal Koster for helpful discussion on the methodology, Jakob Zscheischler for statistical advice, and Urs Beyerle for access to and help with the CESM simulations.

The multiple regression analysis revealed that individuals' demographics, transformational style of leadership, and task orientation are essential to explain museum employees' innovativeness. Additionally, task orientation partially mediated the association between transformational leadership style and individual innovation.

However, these scale dependencies have not been thoroughly investigated at large watershed scales (defined as drainage areas greater than 1000 km(2)). Quantifying these scale dependencies is critical to understanding how large watersheds will respond to future perturbations; e. g., the long-term streamflow response to climate change and/or changes in land-cover and land-use. Here we investigate the spatial and temporal scaling relationships of all dominant streamflow generation processes in a large alpine watershed in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Observations in the watershed indicate that dominant streamflow processes are spatially and temporally variable. The relative strengths of dominant streamflow mechanisms vary as a function of internal watershed structure (i.e., spatial variability in topographic relief, soil development, groundwater flowpath development, and stream network structure) and external forcing such as timing and character of precipitation. This behavior coupled with previous observations that streamflow from the watershed contained a significant component of basin-scale groundwater, suggests that similar large watersheds may have internal buffering, at least initially, against rapid change.

Here we show that the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and, to a lesser extent, winter ENSO signal have a controlling influence not only concurrently on European extreme precipitation anomaly in winter, but in a delayed way on the extremes in the following seasons. In a similar pattern, there is a strong footprint of summer atmospheric circulations over the Mediterranean Sea on summer extreme precipitation and with 1-, 2- and 3-season lags on the following autumn, winter and spring extremes. The combined influences of the different atmospheric circulation patterns mark a significant step forward for an improved predictability of European extreme precipitation in the state-of-the-art seasonal prediction systems.","[Tabari, Hossein] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Div, Leuven, Belgium; [Willems, Patrick] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium",KU Leuven; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Tabari, H (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Hydraul Div, Leuven, Belgium.",hossein.tabari@kuleuven.be,"Willems, Patrick/A-9715-2010; Tabari, Hossein/E-2911-2015","Willems, Patrick/0000-0002-7085-2570; Tabari, Hossein/0000-0003-2052-4541",King Baudouin Foundation,King Baudouin Foundation,This study was supported by the 2016 Ernest du Bois Fund from the King Baudouin Foundation for the best PhD thesis on the theme of water availability and the protection of the water resources.,,71,39,41,0,27,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,10-Apr,2018,,,,,,,5748,10.1038/s41598-018-24069-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24069-9,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,GC3JK,29636537,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000429679900028,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new parameter, Renovation Impact Index (RII), was developed and used for the assessment. The RII is defined as the performance gradient of indoor hygrothermal conditions over two annual periods, the year before and the year after the renovations. The performances of the two most critical parameters to artwork conservation - temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) - were assessed with respect to conservation specifications. RII was defined over two windows: tight set points specified in the BS 5454 : 2000 Conservation Standard and a relaxed strategy for energy saving potential. 'Global' Performance Index was obtained as a combined effect of T and RH. A seasonal analysis was undertaken for detailed study of renovation impact on individual seasons. Results identified the positive effects of the renovation solutions, with the indoor environment then being less influenced by outdoor weather changes. In addition to energy savings of 27%, the positive RII estimate showed quantitative improvement in hygrothermal performance. The proposed methods can be extended to other renovation projects in similar buildings to assist building managers to target future improvements.","[Ganguly, Shashwat; Wang, Fan] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Bldg Design, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Browne, Michael] Natl Galleries Scotland, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Ganguly, S (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Energy Geosci Infrastruct & Soc, Ctr Excellence Sustainable Bldg Design, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",sg373@hw.ac.uk,"Wang, Fan/K-5602-2019","Wang, Fan/0000-0003-0020-1470",Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) Scotland; NGS; University of Edinburgh; Heriot-Watt University,Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) Scotland; NGS; University of Edinburgh; Heriot-Watt University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article was a part of a funded project between the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) Scotland, NGS, University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University.",,31,5,5,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1420-326X,1423-0070,,INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON,Indoor Built Environ.,APR,2019,4,,,,492,505,,10.1177/1420326X18785791,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1420326X18785791,,,14,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",HP0WZ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000461388600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, farmers resort to weather and seasonal forecast to manage uncertainties in decision-making. However, there is limited empirical research on how forecast lead time and probabilities influence farmer decision-making. In this study, we posed the overall question: how do rice farmers respond to forecast information with different probabilities and lead times? We purposively engaged 36 rice farmers (12 rainfed, 12 irrigated and 12 practising both) in Visually Facilitated Scenario Mapping Workshops (VFSMW) to explore how probabilities and lead times inform their decision-making. Results of the VFSMW showed rainfed rice farmers are most sensitive to forecast probabilities because of their over-reliance on rainfall. Also, an increase in forecast probability does not necessarily mean farmers will act. The decision to act based on forecast probability is dependent on the stage of the farming cycle. Also, seasonal forecast information provided at a 1 month lead time significantly informed farmer decision-making compared to a lead time of 2 or 3 months. Also, weather forecast provided at a lead time of 1 week is more useful for decision-making than at a 3 day or 1 day lead time. We conclude that communicating forecast information with their probabilities and at an appropriate lead time has the potential to help farmers manage risks and improve decision-making. We propose that climate services in Northern Ghana should aim at communicating weather and seasonal climate forecast information at 1 week and 1 month lead times respectively. Farmers should also adapt their decisions to the timing and probabilities of the forecast provided.","[Nyamekye, Andy Bonaventure; Dewulf, Art; Biesbroek, Robbert G.; Termeer, Catrien J. A.

This decomposition finds the optimal number of internal modes characterized by their own time scales, which enter the cost function through a specific choice of prior probabilities. The forced climate response, with time dependence estimated from state-of-the-art climate-model simulations, is also incorporated in the present LDM decomposition and shown to increase its optimality from a Bayesian standpoint. On top of the forced signal, the decomposition identifies five distinct LDMs of internal climate variability. The first three modes exhibit multidecadal scales, while the remaining two modes are attributable to interannual-to-decadal variability associated with El Nino-Southern oscillation; all of these modes contribute to the secular climate signal-the so-called global stadium wave-missing in the climate-model simulations. One of the multidecadal LDMs is associated with Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. The two remaining slow modes have secular time scales and patterns exhibiting regional-to-global similarities to the forced-signal pattern. These patterns have a global scale and contribute significantly to SAT variability over the Southern and Pacific Oceans. In combination with low-frequency modulation of the fast LDMs, they explain the vast majority of the variability associated with interdecadal Pacific oscillation. The global teleconnectivity of the secular climate modes and their possible crucial role in shaping the forced climate response are the two key dynamical questions brought about by the present analysis.","[Gavrilov, A.; Kravtsov, S.; Mukhin, D.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Appl Phys, 46 Ulyanov Str, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia; [Gavrilov, A.; Mukhin, D.] Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Res & Educ Math Ctr Math Future Technol, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia; [Kravtsov, S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Atmospher Sci Grp, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53217 USA; [Kravtsov, S.] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, 36 Nahimovskiy Pr, Moscow 117997, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology,"Gavrilov, A (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Appl Phys, 46 Ulyanov Str, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia.;Gavrilov, A (corresponding author), Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Res & Educ Math Ctr Math Future Technol, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia.",gavrilov@ipfran.ru,"Mukhin, Dmitry/U-1058-2017","Mukhin, Dmitry/0000-0002-5669-0771; Gavrilov, Andrey/0000-0001-9779-7308","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office; Russian Science Foundation [19-42-04121, 18-12-00231]","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF))","Support for the 20th Century Reanalysis Project version 2c dataset is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research (BER) and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office.

There is literature advocating for exploring evaporative cooling in hot and humid climates, having observed that when fine mist is deposited on skin, thermal comfort can be achieved. However, there are only a handful of studies considering the efficacy of misting prototypes in these environments. Thus, an experimental study was conducted to explore the impact of simple mist cooling technologies on outdoor comfort. A full-scale misting prototype was built in the city of Antofagasta, located in the Atacama desert region of Chile, and experiencing high humidity and massive solar radiation. The generated environmental conditions were measured, and thermal comfort questionnaires used to supplement quantitative data interpretation with information on the levels of comfort achieved. The experiment demonstrated the potential of mist cooling in this environment, which led to a significant reduction in air temperature, mean radiant temperature and thus on the universal thermal climate index, without significant increases in ambient humidity. Results showed over a 15 degrees C cooling effect in all three metrics at peak times, and occupants consistently reported a cooling effect after spending time within the mist. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The present study provides a preliminary, yet up-to-date, assessment of the prediction skill of the BSISO in four state-of-the-art models: the ECMWF model, the University of Hawaii (UH) model, the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), and version 1 for the 2008 summer (CFSv1), which is a common year of two international programs: the Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) and Asian Monsoon Years (AMY). The mean prediction skill over the global tropics and Southeast Asia for first three models reaches about 1-2 (3) weeks for BSISO-related rainfall (850-hPa zonal wind), measured as the lead time when the spatial anomaly correlation coefficient drops to 0.5. The skill of CFSv1 is consistently lower than the other three. The strengths and weaknesses of the CFSv2, UH, and ECMWF models in forecasting the BSISO for this specific year are further revealed. The ECMWF and UH have relatively better performance for northward-propagating BSISO when the initial convection is near the equator, although they suffer from an early false BSISO onset when initial convection is in the off-equatorial monsoon trough. However, CFSv2 does not have a false onset problem when the initial convection is in monsoon trough, but it does have a problem with very slow northward propagation. After combining the forecasts of CFSv2 and UH into an equal-weighted multimodel ensemble, the resultant skill is slightly better than that of individual models. An empirical model shows a comparable skill with the dynamical models. A combined dynamical-empirical ensemble advances the intraseasonal forecast skill of BSISO-related rainfall to three weeks.","[Fu, Xiouhua; Lee, June-Yi; Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, IPRC, SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Wanqiu] Natl Ctr Environm Predict, Climate Predict Ctr, Camp Springs, MD USA; [Vitart, Frederic] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Fu, XH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, IPRC, SOEST, 1680 East West Rd,POST Bldg 409D, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",xfu@hawaii.edu,"Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021; Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Fu, Joshua/0000-0001-5464-9225","NOAA [NA11OAR4310096, NA10OAR 4310247]; National Science Foundation [AGS-1005599]; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NASA; NOAA; Asia-Pacific Economic Commission (APEC) Climate Center; China Meteorological Administration (CMA) project [GYHY201206016]",NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Asia-Pacific Economic Commission (APEC) Climate Center; China Meteorological Administration (CMA) project,"This work was sponsored by NOAA (NA11OAR4310096 and NA10OAR 4310247) and National Science Foundation (AGS-1005599), and by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), NASA, and NOAA through their supports of the IPRC.

However, the Murujuga rock art is potentially threatened by local industrial air pollution, in particular by acid rain, but unambiguous scientific evidence is still missing. Here, we report on results of an accelerated weathering experiment, simulating Murujuga weather and climate conditions that was designed and performed to test whether the expected small changes in chemical, mineralogical, and physical characteristics of the rock surface can be detected and reliably quantified by various analytical means. Locally acquired Murujuga granophyre and gabbro samples with natural varnish were artificially weathered for up to four months in a climate chamber under conditions that simulated 2 years of natural weathering. Mineralogical, chemical, and physical changes were qualitatively monitored by X-ray diffraction and confocal Raman spectroscopy, and quantified by colorimetry, portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and micro-computed tomography. In addition, artificial rainwater that was sprinkled over the rock samples was collected and analysed by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results show significant chemical and physical changes of the surfaces of the rock varnish after 1 month of artificial weathering. The analytical results demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively monitor small changes caused by the weathering of gabbro and granophyre. Therefore, such a semi-actualistic experimental approach, when carefully designed, potentially allows testing the hypothesis that the weathering rate of the Murujuga petroglyphs is increased by local industrial air pollution. Further experimental work is currently under way.","[Neumann, Jolam T.; Lagos, Markus; Geisler, Thorsten] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, Div Geochem & Petr, Meckenheimer Allee 169, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Black, John L.; Smith, Benjamin W.; Watkins, Ron] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Rock Art Res & Management, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Hoerle, Stephane] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5199, PACEA, Bat B2,Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire CS 50023, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Hoerle, Stephane; Smith, Benjamin W.] Univ Witwatersrand, GAES, Rock Art Res Inst, P Bag 3,PO Wits, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ziegler, Alexander] Univ Bonn, Inst Evolut Biol & Okol, Immenburg 1, D-53121 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Western Australia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; University of Witwatersrand; University of Bonn,"Neumann, JT (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, Div Geochem & Petr, Meckenheimer Allee 169, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",jolam@uni-bonn.de,"; Smith, Benjamin/A-3677-2008","Hoerle, Stephane/0000-0001-8440-2119; Smith, Benjamin/0000-0003-1215-4093","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [INST 217/849-1 FUGG, INST 217/653-1 FUGG, INST 217/1010-1 FUGG]; Projekt DEAL; University of Bonn; Rosa-Luxemburg-Foundation",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Projekt DEAL; University of Bonn; Rosa-Luxemburg-Foundation,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The ENSO teleconnections are known to affect Arctic temperature; however, the robustness of this relationship remains debated. We find that Arctic surface temperatures during three major El Nino events are remarkably well simulated by a state-of-the-art model when nudged to the observed pantropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). SST perturbation experiments show that the 1982-1983 warm pan-Arctic and the 1997-1998 cold pan-Arctic during winter can be explained by far eastern equatorial Pacific SSTs being higher during 1997-1998 than 1982-1983. Consistently, during the 2017-2018 La Nina, unusually low SSTs in the same region contributed to pan-Arctic warming. These pan-Arctic responses to the SSTs are realized through latent heating anomalies over the western and eastern tropical Pacific. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing SST amplitude and pattern for Arctic climate predictions.","[Jeong, Hyein; Park, Hyo-Seok; Yeh, Sang-Wook] Hanyang Univ, Inst Ocean & Atmosphere Sci IOAS, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Park, Hyo-Seok; Yeh, Sang-Wook] Hanyang Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Convergence Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Hanyang University; Hanyang University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Park, HS (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Inst Ocean & Atmosphere Sci IOAS, Ansan 15588, South Korea.;Park, HS (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Convergence Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",hspark1@gmail.com,"Stuecker, Malte Fabian/H-6304-2011; Yeh, Sang-Wook/G-3007-2014","Stuecker, Malte Fabian/0000-0001-8355-0662; Yeh, Sang-Wook/0000-0003-4549-1686; Jeong, Hyein/0000-0002-2235-7188","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) [2020R1A2C2010025]; NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program [NA20OAR4310445]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) no. 2020R1A2C2010025.

These cycles are ultimately regulated by fluctuations in high latitude, northern hemisphere, seasonal solar radiation caused by orbital perturbations. Trace gas records front ice cores reveal variations lit atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentrations that parallel climate fluctuations. The sensitivity of global temperatures to increasing greenhouse gases (approximately 2 degrees C for a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations), as estimated from palaeoclimate records, is close to that derived from numerical modelling of future greenhouse warming. Comparison of records of past climate states with numerical climatic model simulations show that previous versions of general circulation models (GCMs) have not performed well in Oceania, possibly because of inaccurate sea surface temperatures, a lack of an interactive ocean, and coarse resolution. More recent GCM versions perform better with present climates, and give indications of better performance in modelling past climates. While palaeorecords of climate change can provide no close parallel to greenhouse warming as the primary forcing and its spatial distribution differs, they do indicate how biotic and physical systems react to climate change. The most recent warming events comparable in size to those expected in the near future led to major biotic changes. Vegetation assemblages during the last prolonged episode (8000 to 6000 BP), when temperatures were warmer (0.5-1.5 degrees C) than present, were markedly different from those of today. The current climatic regime that established between 3000 and 2000 years ago is highly variable. High resolution records show some decades and centuries have had higher or lower than average numbers of warmer or wetter years, but there have been no sustained periods of highly deviant climate. The much publicised Medieval Warm Period (9th to the 14th century) and the Little Ice Age (17th to mid 19th century) do not appear as discrete events in these records from the Australia-New Zealand region. The warming of recent decades is art unusual event as shown by the long-term perspective of these records. Palaeorecords show the Antarctic region to be highly sensitive to warming and, with future warming, sea ice extent could be dramatically reduced On a much longer timescale, the unstable West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be vulnerable to collapse because of the effects of rising sea levels. Despite an increase in detailed palaeoenvironmental records from all parts of Oceania, extraction of unequivocal climatic parameters remains an elusive goal.

Here, we study the effects of altered rainfall at 33 sites in North America, as projected by the high-resolution/high-fidelity (similar to 4 km, 1 hr) continental-wide Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) convection-permitting model under a high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5). We make use of a stochastic weather generator to extend WRF outputs, accounting for natural variability and simultaneously separate the changes in total rainfall, its seasonality, and its intraseasonal pattern. We used these rainfall scenarios to study ecosystem responses with the state-of-the-art Tethys-Chloris terrestrial biosphere model. Model simulations suggest that increases in mean annual rainfall dominate ecosystem responses at dry sites, while wet sites are less sensitive to rainfall changes. Sites of intermediate wetness face reductions in productivity, due to reduced growing season rainfall and increased water losses under altered seasonality, which outpace any possible benefits induced by increases in mean annual totals. Changes in the fine-scale temporal structure of rainfall have an insignificant impact on ecosystem productivity and only alter hydrological dynamics, contradicting expectations based on some field experiments, which, however, are not tailored to directly quantify climate change impacts, but rather to understand the mechanisms leading to ecosystem responses. We further demonstrate how approaches following the fewer but larger rainfall events concept might exacerbate ecosystem responses.","[Moustakis, Yiannis; Onof, Christian; Paschalis, Athanasios] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Fatichi, Simone] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Imperial College London; National University of Singapore,"Moustakis, Y (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England.",i.moustakis18@imperial.ac.uk,,"Fatichi, Simone/0000-0003-1361-6659; , Athanasios/0000-0003-4833-9962; Moustakis, Yiannis/0000-0002-4448-2967","Skempton Fellowship of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London; NERC [NE/S003495/1]; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1","Skempton Fellowship of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 1(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","Yiannis Moustakis acknowledges funding from the Skempton Fellowship of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London.

The occurrence of extreme precipitation is often closely linked to the DCP. Future changes in extreme precipitation may furthermore, in certain regions, exhibit a strong diurnal signal. Here we investigate the present and future diurnal cycle of hourly precipitation in the state-of-the-art 0.11 degrees C EURO-CORDEX (EC-11) ensemble and in a convection-permitting model (CPM), with a focus on extremes. For the present climate, long-standing timing and frequency biases in the DCP found in lower-resolution models persist in the EC-11 ensemble. In the CPM, however, these biases are largely absent, particularly the diurnal distribution of extremes, which the EC-11 ensemble misrepresents. For future changes to hourly precipitation, we find clear diurnal signals in the CPM and in EC-11 models, with high regional and intra-ensemble variability. The diurnal signal typically peaks in the morning. Interestingly, the EC-11 ensemble mean shows reasonable agreement with the CPM on the diurnal signal's timing, showing that this feature is representable by models with parametrized convection. Comparison with the CPM suggests that EC-11 models greatly underestimate the amplitude of this diurnal signal. Our study highlights the advantages of CPMs for investigating future precipitation change at the diurnal scale, while also showing the EC-11 ensemble capable of detecting a diurnal signal in future precipitation change.","[Meredith, Edmund P.; Ulbrich, Uwe; Rust, Henning W.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Truhetz, Heimo] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Graz, Austria",Free University of Berlin; University of Graz,"Meredith, EP (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Carl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.",edmund.meredith@met.fu-berlin.de,,"Meredith, Edmund/0000-0001-7555-0005","German Ministry for Education and Science (Bundesmininsterium fur Bildung und Forschung) through the ClimXtreme project [01LP1902H]; EU H2020 project BINGO [641739]; EUREX project of the Helmholtz Association [HRJRG-308]; Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) by its Scientific Steering Committee (WLA) [bb0961, bb1152]; Julich Supercomputing Centre via the JARA computing time project [JJSC39]; John von Neumann Institute for Computing (NIC) project [HKA19]",German Ministry for Education and Science (Bundesmininsterium fur Bildung und Forschung) through the ClimXtreme project; EU H2020 project BINGO; EUREX project of the Helmholtz Association; Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) by its Scientific Steering Committee (WLA); Julich Supercomputing Centre via the JARA computing time project; John von Neumann Institute for Computing (NIC) project,"This study was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Science (Bundesmininsterium fur Bildung und Forschung) through the ClimXtreme project, grant number 01LP1902H.

It includes three national parks (NP): Cape Horn NP, Alberto de Agostini NP, and Yendegaia NP. The CHBR ; is immersed within the Magellanic sub-Antarctic ecoregion, which has been identified as one of the last pristine areas left in the world. Nonetheless, it is not free from local and global threats, such as invasive exotic species, climate change, massive tourism and other economic activities that do not value biological and cultural diversity. To contribute towards an appreciation of the values of biocultural diversity, the scientific team at Omora Park (Navarino Island, 55 degrees S), has developed the Field Environmental Philosophy (FEP) methodological approach, which integrates ecological sciences, arts, and environmental ethics through four interrelated steps: 1) interdisciplinary research, 2) poetic communication through the composition of metaphors, 3) design of field activities with an ethical and ecological orientation, and 4) in situ conservation, to contribute to biocultural conservation. We present the methods and results of a multidisciplinary work focused on invertebrates and freshwater ecosystems of the CHBR, with the aim to contribute: a) to a better understanding of the possible responses of aquatic insects to climate change in the long-term, and b) generate tools for research and education to ecologically and ethically value freshwater invertebrates and ecosystems. The conceptual foundations are based on the Land Ethics of Aldo Leopold, and the biocultural ethics of Ricardo Rozzi. Through the praxis of the FEP we generate concrete actions for the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage. Finally, we propose new research methodologies that include valuing of the invertebrates' lives. FEP provides a methodology that contributes towards the transformation of the prevalent way in which global society understands, values and relates to freshwater ecosystems and their co-inhabitants, fostering more respectful and sustainable life habits in the short and long term.","[Contador, Tamara; Rozzi, Ricardo; Kennedy, James; Massardo, Francisca; Ojeda, Jaime; Caballero, Paula; Berchez, Flavio; Stambuk, Andres; Morales, Veronica; Moses, Kelli; Rendoll, Javier] Univ Magallanes, Programa Conservac Biocultural Subantartica, Parque Etnobot Omora, Puerto Williams, Chile; [Rozzi, Ricardo; Kennedy, James] Univ North Texas, Dept Philosophy & Relig, Subantarctic Biocultural Conservat Program, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Contador, Tamara; Rozzi, Ricardo; Kennedy, James] Univ North Texas, Dept Biol Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Contador, Tamara; Rozzi, Ricardo; Massardo, Francisca; Ojeda, Jaime; Caballero, Paula; Moses, Kelli; Rendoll, Javier] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Nunoa, Chile; [Contador, Tamara; Rozzi, Ricardo; Kennedy, James; Saldivia, Fernando; Ganan, Melisa; Arriagada, Gonzalo; Rendoll, Javier; Olivares, Francisco; Lazzarino, Silvia] Univ Magallanes, Lab Wankara, Puerto Williams, Chile; [Medina, Yanet] SEREMI Agr, Magallanes, Chile; [Molina, Rodrigo] Serv Agr Ganadero, Magallanes, Chile; [Saldivia, Fernando] Liceo Donald McIntyre Griffith, Puerto Williams, Chile; [Contador, Tamara] ICM, Nucleo Milenio Salmonidos Invasores, INVASAL, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Magallanes; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Universidad de Magallanes,"Contador, T (corresponding author), Univ Magallanes, Programa Conservac Biocultural Subantartica, Parque Etnobot Omora, Puerto Williams, Chile.",tamara.contador@gmail.com,"Contador, Tamara/AAC-2161-2021; Rozzi, Ricardo/G-1047-2012; Berchez, Flavio/AAD-8214-2021; Ojeda, Jaime/HHN-1455-2022","Contador, Tamara/0000-0002-0250-9877; Rozzi, Ricardo/0000-0001-5265-8726; Ganan Mora, Melisa/0000-0001-6411-9295; Rendoll, Javier/0000-0003-1928-0914",,,,,62,5,8,14,94,UNIV MAGALLANES,PUNTA ARENAS,"INST PAGAGONIA, AVDA BULNES 01890, CASILLA DE CORREOS 113-D, PUNTA ARENAS, MAGALLANES 00000, CHILE",0718-2244,,,MAGALLANIA,Magallania,,2018,1,,,,183,206,,10.4067/S0718-22442018000100183,http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-22442018000100183,,,24,Anthropology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Anthropology,GS9ID,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000444030100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding past Holocene climatic variability, shifts in vegetation, and faunal communities are among crucial challenges in predicting the upcoming changes of the natural environment. In Central Europe, the Krak ' ow-Czestochowa Upland is one of the best study areas for detecting faunal, environmental, and climate shifts. For that reason, we choose to study the small vertebrate and mollusc com-munities of three archaeological sites with Holocene horizons: Saspowska Zachodnia Cave, Ciasna Cave, and Male Rockshelter. We analysed the faunal community shifts, and we compared our results with the major Holocene sites in the area with the correspondence and cluster analyses. The environment and climate were reconstructed through Habitat Weighting, Quantified Ecology, malacological spectra and Bioclimatic methods. Environment and climate values showed a temporary replacement of the Late Glacial tundra and grasslands with boreal forest mixed with open wetlands during the Preboreal and then stable landscapes dominated by temperate forests. Models based on rodent data show that temperature and precipitation generally increased, starting from the Boreal, to reach values near, or sometimes overwhelm, the current climate values of the area during the Atlantic and Subboreal. The climate values obtained from herpetofaunal analyses show very slight changes between the Preboreal and the Atlantic (Ciasna Cave layers 3 and 4), except for the winter temperatures, whereas results obtained for Saspowska Zachodnia Cave are probably biased by a very low number of recovered remains. Among rodents, a major negative oscillation detected in layers related to the edge of Early Holocene was related to the Preboreal Oscillation or long-lasting effect of the Younger Dryas.","[Berto, Claudio; Kot, Malgorzata] Univ Warsaw, Fac Archaeol, Krakowskie Przedmiescie 26-28, PL-00927 Warsaw, Poland; [Szymanek, Marcin] Univ Warsaw, Fac Geol, Zwirki i Wigury 93, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland; [Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IPH, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Univ Rovira i Virgili, Dept Histo & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Pereswiet-Soltan, Andrea] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Krajcarz, Magdalena] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Inst Archaeol, Fac Hist, Szosa Bydgoska 44-48, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",University of Warsaw; University of Warsaw; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Systematics & Evolution of Animals of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Berto, C (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Archaeol, Krakowskie Przedmiescie 26-28, PL-00927 Warsaw, Poland.",c.berto@uw.edu.pl,"Kot, Małgorzata Anna/E-7540-2013; Pereswiet-Soltan, Andrea/AAC-9327-2021","Kot, Małgorzata Anna/0000-0001-5277-0283; Pereswiet-Soltan, Andrea/0000-0002-2083-0648; Szymanek, Marcin/0000-0002-6033-8025; Berto, Claudio/0000-0002-3354-582X; Krajcarz, Magdalena/0000-0003-3720-5926","National Science Centre, Poland [2016/22/E/HS3/00486]; Government of Catalonia, AGAUR [2016/22/E/HS3/00486]; University of Warsaw [2017-SGR-859];  [501-D115-20-0004316]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Government of Catalonia, AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)Generalitat de Catalunya); University of Warsaw; ","The archaeological fieldwork and the small mammals and mala-cofauna analyses were financed by the National Science Centre, Poland, within the framework of project no. 2016/22/E/HS3/00486.

Studies of North African fossil microvertebrates have increased considerably in recent years, but they no longer just provide palaeontological descriptions of the species found in the assemblages. They also aim at better understanding the evolution of faunal communities in relation to Quaternary climate changes and at reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental background of prehistoric human occupations, in well established taphonomic and chronological contexts. These studies are also increasingly adopting an integrative approach by combining archaeology, palaeontology, (palaeo)genetics, taphonomy, palaeoecology and systematics, and using new methods such as geometric morphometrics and isotopic analyses on both fossil and modern specimens. This paper aims to present a history of the studies on Quaternary terrestrial microvertebrates from northwestern Africa, and show how recent multidisciplinary studies have provided new perspectives and evidence on the respective influences of climate change and increasing human pressure on their evolution.

However, uncertainty can exist regarding the ability of source individuals to acclimatise following a shift to a distant location. We investigated the ability of captive-reared juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) of Cook Strait stock (41 degrees S) to adjust to outdoor, predator-protected pens within Orokonui Ecosanctuary (45 degrees S). We examined potential basking and within burrow temperatures, the influence of temperature on emergence, and growth rates in comparison with other locations. Tuatara at Orokonui reached their preferred temperature when basking over summer, and burrows provided protection from freezing over winter. Emergence was temperature-dependent and essentially ceased during winter. Growth rates of Orokonui-held juveniles were within the range for four other captive-rearing facilities and faster than for wild juveniles from a Cook Strait population. As all Orokonui-held juveniles have survived and grown we conclude that the climate at this southern location is suitable to consider a free-release.","[Mello, R. S. R.; Besson, A. A.; Hare, K.

Here, exploring multiple observational data sets and simulations of the state-of-the-art ECHAM6-HAMMOZ chemistry-climate model, we report that the reduction in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown period has enhanced precipitation by 5-25% over India. This precipitation enhancement is the result of the combined effect of an enhancement in cloud cover, a reduction in aerosol induced cloud invigoration and dynamical changes. We observed that the increase in cloud cover was associated with a reduction in cloud base height and an increase in the effective radius of cloud particles which led to an increase in cloud water content. In response to sudden emission reduction, an anomalous northward moisture transport was observed adding convection and precipitation over the Indian region. Importantly, we show that there is an advantage of anthropogenic pollution reduction for water availability in addition to benefits of air quality, human health, and crop yield.","[Asutosh, A.] Indian Inst Technol Bhubaneswar, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; [Fadnavis, S.; Chavan, Prashant; Sabin, T.

The influence of this phenomena on surface and subsurface water resources has not yet been investigated, largely due to lack of enough in situ measurements compounded by the spatial coverage of the lake's basin, incomplete/inconsistent hydrometeorological data, and unavailable governmental data. Within the framework of joint data assimilation into a land surface model from multi-mission satellite remote sensing, this study employs the state-of-art Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment follow-on (GRACE-FO) time-variable terrestrial water storage (TWS), newly released ERA-5 reanalysis, and satellite radar altimetry products to understand the cause of the rise of Lake Victoria on the one hand, and the associated impacts of the rise on the total water storage compartments (surface and groundwater) triggered by the extreme climatic event on the other hand. In addition, the study investigates the impacts of large-scale ocean-atmosphere indices on the water storage changes. The results indicate a considerable increase in water storage over the past two years, with multiple subsequent positive trends mainly induced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Significant storage increase is also quantified in various water components such as surface water and water discharge, where the results show the lake's water level rose by similar to 1.4 m, leading to approximately 1750 gigatonne volume increase. Multiple positive trends are observed in the past two years in the lake's water storage increase with two major events in April-May 2019 and December 2019-January 2020, with the rainfall occurring during the short rainy season of September to November (SON) having had a dominant effect on the lake's rise.","[Khaki, Mehdi] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Awange, Joseph] Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Spatial Sci, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",University of Newcastle; Curtin University,"Awange, J (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Earth & Planetary Sci, Spatial Sci, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",Mehdi.Khaki@Newcastle.edu.au; J.Awange@curtin.edu.au,,"Khaki, Mehdi/0000-0002-3718-2843; Awange, Joseph/0000-0003-3533-613X",,,,,64,5,5,1,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUL,2021,13,,,,,,4304,10.3390/s21134304,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21134304,,,19,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,TG0IB,34201871,Green Published,,,12/21/22,WOS:000671095800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

With these instruments CERES provides state-of-the-art observations and products related to the earth's radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The archived CERES science data products consist of geolocated and calibrated instantaneous filtered and unfiltered radiances through temporally and spatially averaged TOA, surface, and atmospheric fluxes. CERES-filtered radiance measurements cover three spectral bands: shortwave (0.3-5 mu m), total (0.3 > 100 mu m), and an atmospheric window channel (8-12 mu m). CERES climate data products realize a factor of 2-4 improvement in calibration accuracy and stability over the previotus Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) products. To achieve this improvement there are three editions of data products. Edition 1 generates data products using gain coefficients derived from ground calibrations. After a minimum of four months, the calibration data are examined to remove drifts in the calibration. The data are then reprocessed to produce the edition 2 data products. These products are available for science investigations for which an accuracy of 2% is sufficient. Also, a validation protocol is applied to these products to find problems and develop solutions, after which edition 3 data products will be computed, for which the objectives are calibration stability of better than 0.2% and calibration traceability from ground to flight of 0.25%. This paper reports the status of the radiometric accuracy and stability of the CERES edition 2 instrument data products through April 2007.","[Priestley, Kory J.; Smith, G.

Considering multi-criteria decision analysis, this work concentrates on the raking of renewable resources in five climate zones in Iran employing AHP, TOPSIS and SAW methods. In this study, five climate zones of Iran are divided into 'temperate and humid summer, mild winter', 'hot and dry summers, very cold winter', 'very humid and hot summer, mild winter', 'very humid and hot summer without winter' and 'hot and dry summer, cold winter'. For the purpose of raking, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biomass, marine, wind and gravitational energies are considered as the main renewable resources. The alternatives are prioritized from the technical, economic, energy security and social points of view using different sub-criteria. The indicator weights are achieved through a survey of 100 academics and industrial experts whose research interests are energy and environmental science. Based on the results, economic criterion is found to be the most effective criterion. Furthermore, in all of the climate zones in Iran, solar energy and marine energy have the highest and lowest priorities, respectively.","[Sedghiyan, Danial] Art Univ Tehran, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran; [Ashouri, Arezoo] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Maftouni, Negin] Alzahra Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Xiong, Qingang] Gen Motors, IT Innovat Ctr, Warren, MI 48092 USA; [Rezaee, Esmaeil] Univ Sci & Technol Mazandaran, Dept Ind Engn, Sch Engn, Behshahr, Iran; [Sadeghi, Sadegh] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology; Alzahra University; General Motors; University of Science & Technology of Mazandaran; Iran University Science & Technology,"Xiong, QG (corresponding author), Gen Motors, IT Innovat Ctr, Warren, MI 48092 USA.",qgxiong@126.com,,"Rezaee, Esmaeil/0000-0003-2856-4345",,,,,39,28,28,2,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

The variability of ENSO has increased during the 20th century. The cross-correlation between sea surface temperature (SST) and warm water volume (WWV) has also changed during the observational record. From the 1970s onwards, the SST drives WWV anomalies with a lead-time of ten months and the WWV feedbacks onto the SST with a lead-time of eight months. This is reminiscent of a recharge-discharge mechanism of the upper ocean heat content. The full recharge-discharge mechanism is only observed from the 1970s onwards. This could be the result of the degradation of the quality of observations in the early part of the 20th century. However, it may also be a consequence of decadal changes in the coupling between WWV and SST. Additional analysis fitting the recharge oscillator model to the coupled state-of-the-art climate models indicates that ENSO properties show little decadal changes in the climate models. The disagreement in changes in ENSO properties between the reanalysis and the climate models can be due to errors in the available observational data or due to the models missing the low frequency variability and decadal wind trends. Longer and more reliable observational records would be required to validate our results.","[Crespo, Lander R.; Keenlyside, Noel] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Postboks 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Crespo, Lander R.; Keenlyside, Noel] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Postboks 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Belen Rodriguez-Fonseca, Ma; Polo, Irene] UCM, Dept Earth Phys & Astrophys, Plaza Ciencias, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Belen Rodriguez-Fonseca, Ma] CSIC UCM, Inst Geociencias IGEO, Madrid, Spain; [Dommenget, Dietmar] ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO); Monash University,"Rodriguez-Fonseca, MB (corresponding author), UCM, Dept Earth Phys & Astrophys, Plaza Ciencias, Madrid 28040, Spain.;Rodriguez-Fonseca, MB (corresponding author), CSIC UCM, Inst Geociencias IGEO, Madrid, Spain.",brfonsec@ucm.es,"Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; Dommenget, Dietmar/B-9828-2011; Rodriguez-Fonseca, Belen/I-8276-2017","Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Dommenget, Dietmar/0000-0002-5129-7719; Rodriguez-Fonseca, Belen/0000-0002-5261-7083",European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7/2007-2013) PREFACE [603521]; TRIATLAS H2020 project [817578]; ERC STERCP project [648982]; Spanish project PRE4CAST [CGL2017-86415-R]; ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes [CE170100023]; ARC [DP200102329],European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7/2007-2013) PREFACE; TRIATLAS H2020 project; ERC STERCP project; Spanish project PRE4CAST; ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes; ARC(Australian Research Council),"The work was supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7/2007-2013) PREFACE (Grant Agreement No. 603521), the TRIATLAS H2020 project (Grant 817578), the ERC STERCP project (Grant 648982), the Spanish project PRE4CAST (CGL2017-86415-R) the ARC Centre of Excellence in Climate Extremes (CE170100023) and the ARC discovery project Improving projections of regional sea level rise and their credibility (DP200102329).

The external forcing is not found to significantly add variability in any frequency band compared to control simulations where the external drivers are kept constant. Additionally, a method designed to detect a common signal in the time evolution of these circulation patterns among all simulations is proposed, and employed to demonstrate that the null hypothesis of an evolution dominated by internal variability cannot be rejected regardless of the time smoothing applied to the series. Given that the fingerprint of external forcings on atmospheric circulation has been successfully detected in simulations of the 20th century climate and in future climate change projections, we argue that either the effect of past natural forcing is too small, state-of-the-art climate models underestimate their climate sensitivity, or the anthropogenic forcing qualitatively differs from the natural forcing in its effect on main circulation patterns.","[Gomez-Navarro, J.

During one month, a heavily instrumented aircraft with well-characterized aerosol sampling ability carrying well-proven and new aerosol instrumentation devoted most of the 60 available flight hours to flying vertical profiles over the heavily instrumented ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Climate Research Facility (CRF). This allowed us to compare vertical extinction profiles obtained from six different instruments: airborne Sun photometer (AATS-14), airborne nephelometer/absorption photometer, airborne cavity ring-down system, ground-based Raman lidar, and two ground-based elastic backscatter lidars. We find the in situ measured sigma(ep)(lambda) to be lower than the AATS-14 derived values. Bias differences are 0.002-0.004 Km(-1) equivalent to 13-17% in the visible, or 45% in the near-infrared. On the other hand, we find that with respect to AATS-14, the lidar sigma(ep)(lambda) are higher: Bias differences are 0.004 Km(-1) (13%) and 0.007 Km(-1) (24%) for the two elastic backscatter lidars (MPLNET and MPLARM, lambda = 523 nm) and 0.029 Km(-1) (54%) for the Raman lidar (lambda = 355 nm). An unnoticed loss of sensitivity of the Raman lidar had occurred leading up to AIOP, and we expect better agreement from the recently restored system. Looking at the collective results from six field campaigns conducted since 1996, airborne in situ measurements of sigma(ep)(lambda) tend to be biased slightly low (17% at visible wavelengths) when compared to airborne Sun photometer sigma(ep)(lambda). On the other hand, sigma(ep)(lambda) values derived from lidars tend to have no or positive biases. From the bias differences we conclude that the typical systematic error associated with measuring the tropospheric vertical profile of the ambient aerosol extinction with current state-of-the-art instrumentation is 15-20% at visible wavelengths and potentially larger in the UV and near-infrared.","NASA, Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Sonoma, CA USA; NASA, SAIC, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; Pacific NW Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; Ctr Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft S, Marina, CA 93633 USA; Los Gatos Res Inc, Mountain View, CA 94041 USA; NOAA, Air Resources Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County,"Schmid, B (corresponding author), NASA, Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Ames Res Ctr, MS 245-5, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.",bschmid@mail.arc.nasa.gov,"Hallar, Anna Gannet/I-9104-2012; Barnard, Santiago/Q-9795-2019; Redemann, Jens/B-5423-2019; Smirnov, Alexander/O-4168-2019; Welton, Ellsworth J/A-8362-2012; Turner, David D/E-5180-2016; Smirnov, Alexander/C-2121-2009","Hallar, Anna Gannet/0000-0001-9972-0056; Redemann, Jens/0000-0002-2404-7984; Smirnov, Alexander/0000-0002-8208-1304; Welton, Ellsworth J/0000-0003-0208-4861; Turner, David D/0000-0003-1097-897X; Smirnov, Alexander/0000-0002-8208-1304; Schmid, Beat/0000-0002-4705-8715",,,,,110,62,62,4,19,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

Using observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and sea ice conditions with a state-of-the-art atmosphere model, the precipitation totals during late 2010 (the short rains) and early 2011 (the long rains) were simulated hundreds of times to produce possible distributions of precipitation. Alternative distributions of precipitation were produced, consistent with a world with neither anthropogenic forcings nor human influence on SSTs and sea ice. Comparing these modeled distributions to the observed rainfall, no evidence was found for human influence on the 2010 short rains, with their failure being affected by La Nina. However, human influence was found to increase the probability of long rains as dry as, or drier than, 2011. The magnitude of increase in probability depends on the estimated pattern by which human influence changed observed SSTs.","[Lott, Fraser C.; Christidis, Nikolaos; Stott, Peter A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3BP, Devon, England",Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Lott, FC (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Fitzroy Rd, Exeter EX1 3BP, Devon, England.",fraser.lott@metoffice.gov.uk,"Scott, Peter/GYA-5335-2022; Stott, Peter/N-1228-2016","Stott, Peter/0000-0003-4853-7686; Lott, Fraser/0000-0001-5184-4156",UK Department for International Development (DFID),UK Department for International Development (DFID),"The authors would like thank David P.

The underlying meteorological model is the new nonhydrostatic model system ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) which allows a local grid refinement with two-way interactions between the grids. We develop the extension ART (Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases) with the goal of simulating interactions between trace substances and the state of the atmosphere. Within this paper, we present the basic equations and give an overview of the physical parameterizations as well as numerical methods we use. First applications of the new model system for trace gases, monodisperse particles and polydisperse particles are shown. The simulated distribution of two very short-lived substances (VSLS), bromoform (CHBr3) and dibromomethane (CH2Br2) reflecting the fast upward transport shows a good agreement with observations and previous model studies. Also, the shape of the simulated tropical profiles is well reproduced. As an example for the treatment of monodisperse particles we present the simulated ash plume of the Eyjafjallajokull eruption in April 2010. Here, a novel approach for the source function is applied. The pattern of the simulated distribution of volcanic ash particles shows a good agreement with previous studies. As an example for the treatment of a polydisperse aerosol, where number densities and mass concentrations are accounted for, we simulated the annual emissions of sea salt. We obtain a total emission flux of 26.0 Pg yr(-1) and an emission flux of particles with diameter less than 10 mu m of 7.36 Pg yr(-1).","[Rieger, D.; Bangert, M.; Lundgren, K.; Schroeter, J.; Vogel, H.; Ruhnke, R.; Vogel, B.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Foerstner, J.; Reinert, D.; Zaengl, G.] Deutsch Wetterdienst, D-63067 Offenbach, Germany; [Bischoff-Gauss, I.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Rieger, D (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",daniel.rieger@kit.edu,"Vogel, Bernhard/A-9558-2013; Ruhnke, Roland/J-8800-2012","Vogel, Bernhard/0000-0002-8894-0165; Ruhnke, Roland/0000-0002-0353-1603; Reinert, Daniel/0000-0001-6899-5655; Foerstner, Jochen/0000-0002-7989-462X",,,,,51,24,24,1,11,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The climate change produced by the greenhouse gases, the inefficiency of the energy system or the lack of power supply infrastructure in most of the poor countries, the liberalization of the energy market and the development of new technologies in the field of distributed generation (DG) are the key factors of this revolution. It seems clear that the solution at the moment is the DG. The advantage of DG is the energy generation close to the demand point. It means that DG can lower costs, reduce emissions, or expand the energy options of the consumers. DG may add redundancy that increases grid security even while powering emergency lighting or other critical systems and reduces power losses in the electricity distribution. After the development of the different DG and high efficiency technologies, such as co-generation and tri-generation, the next step in the DG world is the interconnection of different small distributed generation facilities which act together in a DG network as a large power plant controlled by a centralized energy management system (EMS). The main aim of the EMS is to reach the targets of low emissions and high efficiency. The EMS gives priority to renewable energy sources instead of the use of fossil fuels. This new concept of energy infrastructure is referred to as virtual utility (VU). The VU can be defined as a new model of energy infrastructure which consists of integrating different kind of distributed generation utilities in an energy (electricity and heat) generation network controlled by a central energy management system (EMS). The electricity production in the network is subordinated to the heat necessity of every user. The thermal energy is consumed on site; the electricity is generated and distributed in the entire network. The network is composed of one centralized control with the EMS and different clusters of distributed generation utilities and heat storage tanks. Each of these clusters is controlled by a local management station (LMS). Every LMS has information about the requirements (heat, cold and electricity) of the users connected to its cluster and the state of the utilities and water level of the storage tanks in its cluster. The EMS receives the information from the LMSs and sets the electricity input or output of every cluster in the network. With the information ordered by the EMS, the LMS set the run or stand-by of the utilities of its cluster. The benefits of the VU are the optimization of the utilization yield of the whole network, the high reliability of the electricity production, the complete control of the network for achieving the main aim of the EMS, the high velocity for assuming quick changes in the demand of the system and high integration of renewable energy sources, plus the advantages of the DG. This paper indicates the state of the art of the VU concept, analyses the projects that are being developed in this field and considers the future of the VU concept.

We estimate time series of low-degree gravitational variations, Delta C-21, Delta S-21, and Delta C-20 using four different techniques, from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Earth Orientation Parameters (length of day and polar motion), advanced climate models (including atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologicmodels), and satellite laser ranging. We compare these independent estimates at different time scales, and discuss major uncertainties for the various techniques. Independent estimates of Delta C-21, Delta S-21, and Delta C-20 are important for validating the geodetic techniques and for improving understanding of large scale and low frequency mass redistribution within the Earth system.","[Chen, J.

Despite this consistency, significant intermodel spread exists in the simulated Arctic climate related to differences in the Arctic surface radiation budget. Building upon previous work to characterize and understand surface radiation budget biases in climate models, the annual mean and seasonal cycle of the Arctic surface radiation budget in 17 CMIP5 models using the Historical-forcing scenario is evaluated against state-of-the-art Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System Surface Energy Balanced and Filled data. The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble is found to simulate longwave surface fluxes well during the sunlit months (similar to 1Wm(-2) differences in July) but exhibits significant wintertime biases (up to -19Wm(-2)). Shortwave fluxes show substantial across-model spread during summer; the model standard deviation approaches 20Wm(-2) in July. Applying a decomposition analysis to the cloud radiative effect (CRE) seasonal cycles, an unrealistic compensation is uncovered between the model-simulated seasonal cycles of cloud fraction, all-sky/clear-sky flux differences, and surface albedo that enables models to simulate realistic CRE seasonal cycles with unrealistic individual contributions. This unrealistic behavior in models must be constrained to improve Arctic climate simulation; observational uncertainty is sufficient to do so. Lastly, biases in all and clear-sky longwave downwelling fluxes positively correlate with model surface temperature in winter, while in summer surface temperature is most strongly related to clear-sky upwelling radiation biases from surface albedo errors.","[Boeke, Robyn C.] Sci Syst Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Taylor, Patrick C.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Climate Sci Branch, Hampton, VA 23665 USA",Science Systems and Applications Inc; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center,"Boeke, RC (corresponding author), Sci Syst Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA 23666 USA.",robyn.c.boeke@nasa.gov,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021",,NASA Interdisciplinary Studies Program [NNH12ZDA001N-IDS]; NASA Energy and Water Cycle Studies program,NASA Interdisciplinary Studies Program; NASA Energy and Water Cycle Studies program,"This work is funded by the NASA Interdisciplinary Studies Program grant NNH12ZDA001N-IDS.

This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.","[Ferrarini, Andrea; Serra, Paolo; Almagro, Maria; Amaducci, Stefano] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Crop Prod, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Almagro, Maria] Spanish Natl Res Council, Soil & Water Conservat Res Grp, Murcia, Spain; [Trevisan, Marco] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Agr & Environm Chem, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Amaducci, S (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Crop Prod, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",stefano.amaducci@unicatt.it,"Almagro, María/A-9722-2016","Almagro, María/0000-0003-2585-9893; Ferrarini, Andrea/0000-0001-9390-7004; Amaducci, Stefano/0000-0002-6184-9257","Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MIPAAF)","Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MIPAAF)","This manuscript was written as part of the HEDGE-BIOMASS project co-financed by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MIPAAF).",,230,49,50,2,108,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Our results imply that SWV changes provide a novel mechanism for communicating the effects of large tropical volcanic eruptions and ENSO events to the extratropical troposphere over timescales of a few years, which provides a mechanism for interannual climate predictability.

However, decades of exposure in harsh climates have led to advanced deterioration and reduced load ratings for most extant examples. Furthermore, the original concrete is non-air-entrained, potentially lower-strength, and often chloride-contaminated and deeply carbonated, all of which make the concrete difficult to repair and vulnerable to future deterioration. Further complicating rehabilitation, the height, and arch-reliant behavior of these bridges make construction access, staging, and maintenance of traffic challenges.

Currently, state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) have difficulty simulating glacial inception, possibly due in part to their coarse horizontal resolution and the neglect of ice flow dynamics in some models. We attempt to address the role of regional feedbacks in the initial inception problem on Baffin Island by asynchronously coupling the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, configured as a high-resolution inner domain over Baffin and an outer domain incorporating much of North America, to an ice flow model using the shallow ice approximation The mass balance is calculated from WRF simulations and used to drive the ice model, which updates the ice extent and elevation, that then serve as inputs to the next WRF run. We drive the regional WRF configuration using atmospheric boundary conditions from 1986 that correspond to a relatively cold summer, and with 115 kya insolation. Initially, ice accumulates on mountain glaciers, driving downslope ice flow which expands the size of the ice caps. However, continued iterations of the atmosphere and ice models reveal a stagnation of the ice sheet on Baffin Island, driven by melting due to warmer temperatures at the margins of the ice caps. This warming is caused by changes in the regional circulation that are forced by elevation changes due to the ice growth. A stabilizing feedback between ice elevation and atmospheric circulation thus prevents full inception from occurring.","[Birch, Leah; Tziperman, Eli] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Birch, Leah; Tziperman, Eli] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cronin, Timothy] MIT, Dept Earth Atmosphere & Planetary Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Birch, L (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Birch, L (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lbirch@seas.harvard.edu,"Tziperman, Eli/A-1219-2008",,Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund; NSF P2C2 program [OCE-1602864]; NSF [AGS-1740533]; National Science Foundation,Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund; NSF P2C2 program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by the Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund and by the NSF P2C2 program, grant OCE-1602864.

Tatarkiewicz's aesthetical conception. It deals with problems of definition the subject, direction and methodological position of his aesthetical investigations. Author pays attention to the questions of multidimentional character of aesthetical phenomena, foundations of pluralism in aesthetics and value of implicit aesthetics. In philosopher's opinion, aesthetics is science about beaty and science about art - these are two main directions in investigations of aesthetics. There are also some other aesthetical problems. Tatarkiewicz argued that the definition of multidimensional development and formation of concepts of aesthetics significantly expands the scope of its investigations. At the same time it enriches the knowledge about the connection of aesthetics and other forms of consciousness. This approach has received an expression of the methodological basis that common basis sees in the belief in the diversity of phenomena: beautiful, artistic, aesthetic position. As a result of the approval of the heterogeneity phenomena from 1913 the program element of Tatarkiewicz's aesthetics was the notion of pluralism. An important role in the Tatarkiwicz's works play non-aesthetical, social issues. Philosopher emphasized the need to consider and include in aesthetic theory the matter of taste, fashion preferences. He tries as best as possible to convey the intellectual climate of a typical or common definition of the main stages in the development of aesthetic thought. The content of Tatarkiewicz's History of aesthetics defines two areas: explicite aesthetics and aesthetics implicite, contained in the statements, which only in some sense address issues of aesthetics. The philosopher believes that the material of implicit aesthetics gives the history of aesthetics many valuable observations. In this context, we can talk about a kind of egalitarianism of Tatarkiewicz's scientific position. He takes into account the value of many important public and artistic statements, regardless of their position in the established hierarchy. Tatarkiewicz attached the great importance to studying the history of aesthetics, because he believed that it helps to see the conditions of modern development of aesthetic theory and defines its relationship with artistic practice.","[Shevchuk, Ekaterina S.] Rivne State Humanitarian Univ, Rivne, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Rivne State University of Humanities,"Shevchuk, ES (corresponding author), Rivne State Humanitarian Univ, Rivne, Ukraine.",katerynashevchuk@gmail.com,"Shevchuk, Kateryna/AAD-4428-2020",,,,,,5,0,0,0,4,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1998-863X,2311-2395,,VESTN TOMSK U-FILOS,Vestn.

This study examined the projected changes in precipitation extremes by using state-of-the-art, high-resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) statistically downscaled NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) during southwest monsoon season (June to September) under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The spatial variations of mean precipitation, as well as the extremes obtained from the multi-model mean (MMM) from NEX-GDDP simulations, were compared with Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) observational data for the baseline period (1976-2005). For the future climate, the monsoon precipitation over the Uttarakhand region may increase by similar to 13% and similar to 16% under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios, respectively, in the near future (2021-2050) and may further increase by 23% and 36% in the far future (2070-2099). The different extreme precipitation indices analyzed show an increase with the exception of consecutive dry days (CDDs) over Uttarakhand, both in the near future and in the far future, under both scenarios. The RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios exhibited a noticeable increase in the highest 1-day rainfall (by 1.4 mm decade(-1) and 3.3 mm decade(-1)) and in the highest 5-day rainfall (by 2.7 mm decade(-1) and 7 mm decade(-1)), along with the extreme R95P precipitation days (by 11% and 22%), and consecutive wet days become more frequent during monsoon season, respectively. The study findings highlight the need for considering more extreme rains in base Himalayan climate resiliency planning.","[Vinodhkumar, Buri; Jose, Aathira Maria; Osuri, Krishna Kishore] Natl Inst Technol Rourkela, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Rourkela 769008, Odisha, India; [Rao, K.

Nevertheless, since anaerobic treatment only removes organic carbon, post-treatment is required to remove nitrogen, besides residual organic carbon. Trickling filters (TFs) constitute a cost-effective post-treatment option, assuring low sludge production, low operational costs and maintenance simplicity compared to other post-treatment technologies (e.g. activated sludge). This paper reviews the experience of the last 20 years of research, design and operation of UASB/TF systems. Three main topics are addressed: i) the development of trickling filters for UASB reactor effluent treatment, building on first experiences with TFs preceded by primary settlers; ii) the design criteria, performance and empirical models for predicting the efficiency of TFs post-UASB reactors; and iii) the future challenges associated with elimination of secondary settlers and nitrogen removal in sponge-bed trickling filters (SBTFs).","[Bressani-Ribeiro, T.; Almeida, P.

To address these problems, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is an essential component to consider. One important element is to address economic, environmental and social aspects that are interlinked and mutually dependent. Thus, ESD aims to promote not only the fundamental environmental knowledge, but to empower people to deal with such dilemmas. Therefore, individuals need competences for sustainability. These can be learnt but hardly be taught. Hence, learning environments for ESD should enable individuals to develop these competences and think interdisciplinary. E-learning addresses these challenges and offers opportunities to design effective learning environments for ESD. For instance, with the help of information and communication technologies (ICTs), e-learning can represent the mutual influence of the different dimensions of sustainability. Simulations can offer learner-centered learning scenarios, in which individuals can apply their skills in an authentic situation. This is the basis to gain competences for sustainability. Thus, we expect e-learning modules to increase the quality of the learning process. However, prior research on e-learning modules supporting ESD is limited. A systematic approach of categorising e-learning modules into an instruction model is missing. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to present the state of the art of e-learning usage in ESD. Therefore, we conducted a literature review by analysing eleven databases, selected 35 articles and classified them according to the Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluation (ADDIE) instruction model. Afterwards, we used this model to categorize the research methods and e-learning tools used by the selected articles accordingly. Based on this, we elaborated research gaps and future research directions. The results show that most of the articles primarily focus on the evaluation phase of the ADDIE model. Consequently, they do not provide a complete picture of the ADDIE process of e-learning modules to support ESD. Moreover, current research does not show how to create competences as an outcome for ESD. Further research should try to give a complete picture of the e-learning modules for ESD from the analysis phase to the evaluation phase. In addition, further research should also focus on how to design learning environments for the development of competences and how to measure them.","[Anke, Jan Moritz; Schumann, Matthias] Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Anke, JM (corresponding author), Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,3,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-697-3777-4,EDULEARN PROC,,,2017,,,,,5777,5786,,,,,,10,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BO0RJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000493048100112,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new generation of climate models has been used to generate LGM simulations as part of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) contribution to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Here, we provide a preliminary analysis and evaluation of the results of these LGM experiments (PMIP4, most of which are PMIP4-CMIP6) and compare them with the previous generation of simulations (PMIP3, most of which are PMIP3-CMIP5). We show that the global averages of the PMIP4 simulations span a larger range in terms of mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual precipitation compared to the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations, with some PMIP4 simulations reaching a globally colder and drier state. However, the multi-model global cooling average is similar for the PMIP4 and PMIP3 ensembles, while the multi-model PMIP4 mean annual precipitation average is drier than the PMIP3 one. There are important differences in both atmospheric and oceanic circulations between the two sets of experiments, with the northern and southern jet streams being more poleward and the changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation being less pronounced in the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations than in the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations. Changes in simulated precipitation patterns are influenced by both temperature and circulation changes. Differences in simulated climate between individual models remain large. Therefore, although there are differences in the average behaviour across the two ensembles, the new simulation results are not fundamentally different from the PMIP3-CMIP5 results. Evaluation of large-scale climate features, such as land-sea contrast and polar amplification, confirms that the models capture these well and within the uncertainty of the paleoclimate reconstructions. Nevertheless, regional climate changes are less well simulated: the models underestimate extratropical cooling, particularly in winter, and precipitation changes. These results point to the utility of using paleoclimate simulations to understand the mechanisms of climate change and evaluate model performance.","[Kageyama, Masa; Bouttes, Nathaelle; Lhardy, Fanny; Quiquet, Aurelien; Roche, Didier M.] Univ Paris Saclay, UMR CEA CNRS UVSQ, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, Sch Archaeol Geog & Environm Sci SAGES, Reading, Berks, England; [Kapsch, Marie-L; Mikolajewicz, Uwe] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Lofverstrom, Marcus; Tierney, Jessica E.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Lora, Juan M.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sherriff-Tadano, Sam; Vadsaria, Tristan; Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Univ Tokyo, Atmospher & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Chandan, Deepak; Peltier, W.

The reanalysis products examined in this study generally show much lower cloud amount than visual weather station data, and this underestimation appears to be generally consistent with their overestimation of downward surface shortwave fluxes when compared with surface radiation data from the Surface Radiation Network. Nevertheless, the reanalysis products largely succeed in simulating the main aspects of interannual variability of cloudiness for large-scale means, as measured by correlations of 0.81-0.90 for U.S. mean time series. Trends in the reanalysis datasets for the U.S. mean for 1979-2009, ranging from 20.38% to 21.8% decade 21, are in the same direction as the trend in surface data (20.50% decade 21), but further effort is needed to understand the discrepancies in their magnitudes.","[Free, Melissa] NOAA, Air Resources Lab, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Sun, Bomin] NOAA Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, IM Syst Grp, College Pk, MD USA; [Yoo, Hye Lim] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, Coll Pk, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Free, M (corresponding author), NOAA, Air Resources Lab, 5830 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.",melissa.p.free@gmail.com,"Sun, Bomin/P-8742-2014","Sun, Bomin/0000-0002-4872-9349",NOAA's Climate Program Office,NOAA's Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This work was funded in part by NOAA's Climate Program Office.

This is reflected in the rising concerns about the discomfort and heat stress to building occupants caused by the increasing indoor temperatures. European standard BS15251 and Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) guidance note TM52 are documents that address the issue. Both include a methodology predicting the probability of overheating in buildings. Despite this, many modern buildings overheat. This paper looks at the criteria from CIBSE TM52 and discusses their applicability to a single UK dwelling archetype. This was modelled and then located in a range of European cities to understand the causes of overheating and the means of reducing it. Results highlight some problems in practice using simulations tools to evaluate overheating and the fundamental assumptions on which they are based. Energy performance and thermal comfort of dwellings were assessed using morphed climates for each location for 2020, 2050 and 2080.","[Brotas, Luisa; Nicol, Fergus] London Metropolitan Univ, Sir John Cass Sch Art Architecture & Design, Low Energy Architecture Res Unit, Whitechapel High St, London E1 7PF, England",London Metropolitan University,"Brotas, L (corresponding author), London Metropolitan Univ, Sir John Cass Sch Art Architecture & Design, Low Energy Architecture Res Unit, Whitechapel High St, London E1 7PF, England.",l.brotas@londonmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,12,12,1,30,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-8628,1758-9622,,ARCHIT SCI REV,Archit.

We conducted a thorough literature review in order to assess the state of the art in the scientific research that has been performed on Mexican coastal dunes. We found that 47% of the studies focused on plant ecology mostly along the Atlantic coast. The state of Veracruz has been the most studied (86). In addition, the spatial distribution of 844 plant species and 166 of animal species have been reported. Four hundred ecological interactions have demonstrated the relevance of different species for reproductive fitness in plants and plant succession processes. The studies highlight human activities as the main stressor on coastal dunes systems. We conclude that it is necessary to use biodiversity variables as ecological indicators for monitoring climate changes as well as the impacts of human activities on coastal dunes.

Previous studies have suggested that this shoaling necessarily accompanies Antarctic sea ice expansion at the LGM. Here the influence of Southern Ocean surface forcing on the AMOC depth is investigated using ocean-only simulations from a state-of-the-art climate model with surface forcing specified from the output of previous coupled PI and LGM simulations. In contrast to previous expectations, we find that applying LGM surface forcing in the Southern Ocean and PI surface forcing elsewhere causes the AMOC to shoal only about half as much as when LGM surface forcing is applied globally. We show that this occurs because diapycnal mixing renders the Southern Ocean overturning circulation more diabatic than previously assumed, which diminishes the influence of Southern Ocean surface buoyancy forcing on the depth of the AMOC.","[Sun, Shantong; Eisenman, Ian] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Stewart, Andrew L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Sun, ST (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",shantong@ucsd.edu,"Sun, Shantong/AAY-2000-2020; Sun, Shantong/AAL-8285-2021; Eisenman, Ian/B-9329-2009","Sun, Shantong/0000-0002-6932-5589; Stewart, Andrew/0000-0001-5861-4070; Eisenman, Ian/0000-0003-0190-2869","National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1357078, PLR-1543338, OPP-1643445]; Directorate For Geosciences [1357078] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Without implying their endorsement, we thank Paola Cessi, Shang-Ping Xie, Lynne Talley, Raffaele Ferrari, Malte Jansen, Jess Adkins, and Paul Kushner for helpful comments and discussions.

Periods I and II (9.1-4.9 ka) were wetter and punctuated by a series of prominent droughts. Periods IV-VI (4-0.94 ka) were much drier and less variable. Period III (4.9-4 ka) marks the transition between wetter and drier conditions and consists of two significant droughts: the first (4.8-4.6 ka) coincides approximately with the end of the African Humid Period and the second (43-4.0 ka) may be the expression of the Northern Hemisphere 4.2 ka dry event in northwest Madagascar. Strong positive correlations between delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in Periods I-IV (r = 0.63-0.91) suggest that both isotopes were influenced by natural climate changes indicating that humans may not have been present in the area. In contrast, during Periods V (r = 0.07) and VI (r = -0.12) the decoupling of delta C-13 and delta O-18 might signal an impact from human activities starting around 2.5 ka. Rapid changes in climate during the early and middle Holocene, with prominent droughts lasting up to 800 years, did not kill off Madagascar's megafauna, and neither did a human population, present since the early Holocene if evidence from south Madagascar is reliable. However, many extinctions occurred under the more stable climatic conditions of the late Holocene, despite an antiphase climate relationship between northern and southcentral Madagascar. This suggests that initial human colonization, or significant increase in human population, triggered the megafaunal extinctions by hunting and destruction of megafaunal habitats.

In this study, an eddy-permitting and a coarse resolution numerical experiment are conducted to simulate the global ocean state for the period of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 26 500 to 19 000 yr ago) and to investigate the improvements due to taking into account the smaller spatial scales. The ocean state from each simulation is confronted with a data set from the Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean (MARGO) sea surface temperatures (SSTs), some reconstructions of the palaeo-circulations and a number of sea-ice reconstructions. The western boundary currents and the Southern Ocean dynamics are better resolved in the high-resolution experiment than in the coarse simulation, but, although these more detailed SST structures yield a locally improved consistency between model predictions and proxies, they do not contribute significantly to the global statistical score. The SSTs in the tropical coastal upwelling zones are also not significantly improved by the eddy-permitting regime. The models perform in the mid-latitudes but as in the majority of the Paleo-climate Modelling Intercomparison Project simulations, the modelled sea-ice conditions are inconsistent with the palaeo-reconstructions. The effects of observation locations on the comparison between observed and simulated SST suggest that more sediment cores may be required to draw reliable conclusions about the improvements introduced by the high resolution model for reproducing the global SSTs. One has to be careful with the interpretation of the deep ocean state which has not reached statistical equilibrium in our simulations. However, the results indicate that the meridional overturning circulations are different between the two regimes, suggesting that the model parametrizations might also play a key role for simulating past climate states.","[Ballarotta, M.; Brodeau, L.; Lundberg, P.; Doos, K.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol Oceanog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Brandefelt, J.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Mech, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Royal Institute of Technology,"Ballarotta, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Meteorol Oceanog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",maxime.ballarotta@natgeo.su.se,"; Doos, Kristofer/H-2838-2012","BALLAROTTA, Maxime/0000-0002-4101-8704; Brodeau, Laurent/0000-0001-8745-7510; Doos, Kristofer/0000-0002-1309-5921",Bert Bolin Centre for Climate Research; Swedish Research Council; Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation,Bert Bolin Centre for Climate Research; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation),"This work has been financially supported by the Bert Bolin Centre for Climate Research and by the Swedish Research Council.

This paper might be of interest to readers of JPD because it should prompt them to share and submit their good practice. Given that the central premise of this paper is to explore current trends around how and even why HE practitioners engage with pedagogic research, then we should be open to having this question convincingly answered, at least in part.

Yet, the climate effect of individual LCLMC options, their dependence on the background climate, and the local vs. non-local responses are still poorly understood across different Earth system models (ESMs). Here we simulate the climatic effects of LCLMC using three state-of-the-art ESMs, including the Community Earth System Model (CESM), the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), and the European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH). We assess the LCLMC effects using four idealized experiments: (i) a fully afforested world, (ii) a world fully covered by cropland, (iii) a fully afforested world with extensive wood harvesting, and (iv) a full cropland world with extensive irrigation. In these idealized sensitivity experiments performed under present-day climate conditions, the effects of the different LCLMC strategies represent an upper bound for the potential of global mitigation and local adaptation. To disentangle the local and non-local effects from the LCLMC, a checkerboard-like LCLMC perturbation, i.e. alternating grid boxes with and without LCLMC, is applied. The local effects of deforestation on surface temperature are largely consistent across the ESMs and the observations, with a cooling in boreal latitudes and a warming in the tropics. However, the energy balance components driving the change in surface temperature show less consistency across the ESMs and the observations. Additionally, some biases exist in specific ESMs, such as a strong albedo response in CESM mid-latitudes and a soil-thawing-driven warming in boreal latitudes in EC-EARTH. The non-local effects on surface temperature are broadly consistent across ESMs for afforestation, though larger model uncertainty exists for cropland expansion. Irrigation clearly induces a cooling effect; however, the ESMs disagree regarding whether these are mainly local or non-local effects. Wood harvesting is found to have no discernible biogeophysical effects on climate. Our results overall underline the potential of ensemble simulations to inform decision-making regarding future climate consequences of land-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.","[De Hertog, Steven J.; Vanderkelen, Inne; Thiery, Wim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium; [Havermann, Felix; Guo, Suqi; Pongratz, Julia] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Luo, Fei; Manola, Iris; Coumou, Dim] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Luo, Fei; Coumou, Dim] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Davin, Edouard L.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Davin, Edouard L.; Seneviratne, Sonia, I] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Duveiller, Gregory] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Lejeune, Quentin; Schleussner, Carl-Friedrich] Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany; [Pongratz, Julia] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Munich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society,"De Hertog, SJ (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Brussels, Belgium.",steven.de.hertog@vub.be,"Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016; Duveiller, Gregory/A-4932-2016","Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; Lejeune, Quentin/0000-0001-9152-3197; Vanderkelen, Inne/0000-0002-8673-1933; Luo, Fei/0000-0002-2450-6159; Coumou, Dim/0000-0003-2155-8495; Duveiller, Gregory/0000-0002-6471-8404",DLR/BMBF (DE) [01LS1905A]; NWO (NL); Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO); European Union [300478]; European Research Council (ERC) Synergy Grant Understanding and Modelling the Earth System with Machine Learning (USMILE) [855187],DLR/BMBF (DE); NWO (NL); Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); European Union(European Commission); European Research Council (ERC) Synergy Grant Understanding and Modelling the Earth System with Machine Learning (USMILE)(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was funded by the DLR/BMBF (DE, grant no. 01LS1905A), NWO (NL), and the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) and co-funded by the European Union through the project LAnd MAnagement for CLImate Mitigation and Adaptation (LAMACLIMA) (grant agreement no. 300478), which is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate.

Modelers should do a better job of making clear what is known (including realistic estimates of the uncertainties) and what is not known. Public policy regarding climate change and earthquake hazard mitigation must be decided now, notwithstanding the limitations of the state of the art of modeling.

Over the past two decades, we have witnessed an increase in drought risk assessments across spatial and temporal scales drawing on a multitude of conceptual foundations and methodological approaches. Recognizing the diversity of approaches in science and practice as well as the associated opportunities and challenges, we present the outcomes of a systematic literature review of the state of the art of people-centered drought vulnerability and risk conceptualization and assessments, and identify persisting gaps. Our analysis shows that, of the reviewed assessments, (i) more than 60% do not explicitly specify the type of drought hazard that is addressed, (ii) 42% do not provide a clear definition of drought risk, (iii) 62% apply static, index-based approaches, (iv) 57% of the indicator-based assessments do not specify their weighting methods, (v) only 11% conduct any form of validation, (vi) only ten percent develop future scenarios of drought risk, and (vii) only about 40% of the assessments establish a direct link to drought risk reduction or adaptation strategies, i.e. consider solutions. We discuss the challenges associated with these findings for both assessment and identification of drought risk reduction measures, and identify research needs to inform future research and policy agendas in order to advance the understanding of drought risk and support pathways towards more drought resilient societies.","[Hagenlocher, Michael; Meza, Isabel; Min, Annika; Walz, Yvonne; Sebesvari, Zita] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Anderson, Carl C.; Renaud, Fabrice G.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Interdisciplinary Studies, Dumfries Campus,Rutherford McCowan Bldg, Dumfries DG1 4ZL, Scotland; [Siebert, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany",University of Glasgow; University of Gottingen,"Hagenlocher, M (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",hagenlocher@ehs.unu.edu,"Anderson, Carl C/AHB-4069-2022; Siebert, Stefan/B-8621-2009; Renaud, Fabrice/M-3249-2017","Siebert, Stefan/0000-0002-9998-0672; Sebesvari, Zita/0000-0001-7686-1227; Hagenlocher, Michael/0000-0002-5254-6713; Anderson, Carl/0000-0002-5344-9800; Renaud, Fabrice/0000-0002-0830-1196; Meza, Isabel/0000-0002-8557-9175",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through its Global Resource Water (GRoW) funding initiative [02WGR1457C],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through its Global Resource Water (GRoW) funding initiative(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research is part of the project GlobeDrought (Grant No. 02WGR1457C) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through its Global Resource Water (GRoW) funding initiative.

It is found that correction of substantial biases in the models' surface air temperature and precipitation fields is necessary. However, even after a bias correction, there are significant differences in the models' ability to reproduce observations. Using metrics based on the ability to reproduce observed temporal and spatial patterns of drought, the relationship between model performance in simulating present-day drought characteristics and their differences in projections of future drought changes is investigated. It is found that all models project increases in future drought frequency and severity. However, using the metrics presented here to increase confidence in the multimodel projection is complicated by a correlation between models' drought metric skill and climate sensitivity. The effect of this sampling error can be removed by changing how the projection is presented, from a projection based on a specific time interval to a projection based on a specified temperature change. This modified class of projections has reduced intermodel uncertainty and could be suitable for a wide range of climate change impacts projections.","[Wehner, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Easterling, David R.; Lawrimore, Jay H.; Heim, Richard R., Jr.; Vose, Russell S.] NOAA, Natl Climat Data Ctr, Asheville, NC USA; [Santer, Benjamin D.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Program Climate Model Diag & Intercomparison, Livermore, CA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"Wehner, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd,MS50F, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",mfwehner@lbl.gov,"Langholtz, Matthew/B-9416-2012; Heim (Jr.), Richard/H-9667-2017; Santer, Ben/ABA-1099-2021; Wehner, Michael/F-7841-2015; Vose, Russell/GSI-5687-2022; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Santer, Benjamin D/F-9781-2011","Langholtz, Matthew/0000-0002-8153-7154; Heim (Jr.), Richard/0000-0003-1701-6861; Wehner, Michael/0000-0001-5991-0082; ","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) [DE-AC03-76SF00098 (LBNL)]; DOE; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Sciences [DE-AI02-96ER62276]; NOAA/Climate Program Office; Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NOAA/Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) under Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 (LBNL) and with support from the DOE Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program.

Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are important tools for simulation of vegetation productivity and can be coupled with other components of Earth system models. This study simulated GPP of terrestrial ecosystems in China from 1982 to 2010 utilizing five state-of-the-art DGVMs, which considered increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. Our models consistently showed an ascending GPP gradient from northwest to southeast China. The annual total GPP in China estimated by the DGVMs (mean = 7.97 PgCyr(-1); range = 6.14-9.76 PgCyr(-1)) were generally higher than estimations from previous studies. The greatest overestimation of GPP occurred in south China in warm, wet climates. All DGVMs and JU11 indicated that annual GPP in China increased from 1982 to 2010. There was a statistically significant correlation between simulated GPP and temperature in the Tibetan Plateau, which was supported by flux tower measurements. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between simulated GPP and precipitation in east China, though this should be interpreted cautiously. Further research is needed to improve simulations to better account for spatial and temporal variations in GPP at regional scales by improving representations of existing processes and incorporating currently unconsidered processes.

However, in most research projects, the main challenge is to integrate new technologies into real-world applications. Over the last decade, pavement energy harvesting has been studied to be used as a sustainable energy source. Harvesting the kinetic energy from vehicles and converting it into electric energy is a sustainable, clean, and potentially efficient way to produce energy. Also, pavement energy harvesting technologies show potential to reduce the speed of vehicles in critical places, such as crosswalks, contributing to the reduction of road accidents. This paper presents a review of mechanical systems that convert kinetic energy from vehicles into electricity, focusing on three main types of technologies: piezoelectric, pneumatic/hydraulic, and electromechanical. Pneumatic and hydraulic systems produce more energy, with an efficiency of 40% for higher readiness levels. Despite its energetic potential, the cost-effectiveness is not yet sufficient. Piezoelectric devices are the most studied, but these are not sufficiently profitable. Quantitatively, the corresponding efficiency remains unclear. Electromechanical systems are the most technologically advanced and efficient, presenting a maximum TRL (technological readiness level) of 7, and a maximum efficiency of 65%.","[Couto, Rui] Fac Engn Univ Porto FEUP, Mech Engn Dept, Porto, Portugal; [Duarte, Francisco] UPTEC, Technol Pavements Ltd, Pavnext, Porto, Portugal; [Magalhaes, Antonio] Polytech Porto ISEP, Mech Engn Dept, Sch Engn, Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Polytechnic Institute of Porto,"Couto, R (corresponding author), Fac Engn Univ Porto FEUP, Mech Engn Dept, Porto, Portugal.",up202102715@up.pt,,,,,,,58,0,0,7,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1556-7036,1556-7230,,ENERG SOURCE PART A,Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

The basic idea of currently available trend estimation techniques (tests) is that the trends should be smooth and monotonic; however, hydro-climatologic variables contain Multiple signals, and have segments of increasing and decreasing trends. As a result. estimating trends in time series is an essential but arcane art and it is therefore important to continue developing the theory and practice of trend analysis. In this paper, a new technique is proposed based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). CWT permits the transformation of observed time series into wavelet coefficients according to time and scale simultaneously. These coefficients can be used to detect and estimate trends or to reconstruct signals that are of interest. The proposed CWT method was first tested on computer-gene rated data exhibiting both periodic and noise components. It was then applied to observed monthly minimum streamflow observations extracted from the Reference Hydrometric Basin Network (RHBN) for five different eco-zones in Canada. It was concluded that the proposed wavelet transform (WT) based method provides a very flexible and accurate tool for detecting and estimating complicated signals. The results from monthly minimum observations indicate that short period fluctuations are decreasing, while multi-annual variability is increasing in Canada. And finally, a persistent similar to 55-year signal is well correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in all records, which indicates that trends are not controlled by a single factor.

There is strong potential to make use of different technical solutions to increase energy efficiency, but many cost-efficient solutions relate to carrot-and-stick incentives for operators to minimise energy consumption. These incentives range from voyage planning with weather routing eco-driving bonus, to torque limitations and changes in company policies, all of which demonstrate that the operators' on-board importance for the energy consumption has been identified. Data collection will allow operators to make better decisions in the lifecycle of the ship from knowledge-driven design to operation, redesign and lifetime extension. Various systems are available for data acquisition, storage and analysis, some of which are delivered by well-known marine suppliers while others are stand-alone systems. The lack of standardization for data capture, transmission and analysis is a challenge, so systematic improvement is required in shipping companies to achieve energy savings. When these are achieved, they will be the result of customer requirements, cost pressure or individual driving forces in the companies. The potential energy savings, brought up in interviews, shows up to 35% on specific routes and up to 60% in specific maneuvers. These savings will be made feasible by operators and crews being involved in the decision-making process.","[Hueffmeier, Johannes] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Mat & Prod Div, S-41346 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Johanson, Mathias] Alkit Commun, R&D Dept, S-43137 Molndal, Sweden",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden,"Huffmeier, J (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Mat & Prod Div, S-41346 Gothenburg, Sweden.",johannes.huffmeier@ri.se; mathias@alkit.se,,"Huffmeier, Johannes/0000-0001-8389-561X",Swedish Energy Agency/Energimyndigheten [49301-1],Swedish Energy Agency/Energimyndigheten(Swedish Energy Agency),This research was funded by the Swedish Energy Agency/Energimyndigheten grant number 49301-1.,,34,4,4,7,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1312,,J MAR SCI ENG,J.

A key factor in projecting climate change is to derive robust signals of future changes in tropical cyclone activity across different model physical schemes and different future patterns in sea surface temperature. A suite of future warming experiments (2075-2099), using a state-of-the-art high-resolution global climate model(1-3), robustly predicts an increase in tropical cyclone frequency of occurrence around the Hawaiian Islands. A physically based empirical model analysis(3,4) reveals that the substantial increase in the likelihood of tropical cyclone frequency is primarily associated with a northwestward shifting of the tropical cyclone track in the open ocean southeast of the islands. Moreover, significant and robust changes in large-scale environmental conditions strengthen in situ tropical cyclone activity in the subtropical central Pacific. These results highlight possible future increases in storm-related socioeconomic and ecosystem damage for the Hawaiian Islands.","[Murakami, Hiroyuki; Kitoh, Akio] Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan; [Murakami, Hiroyuki; Wang, Bin; Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Murakami, Hiroyuki; Wang, Bin; Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Murakami, Hiroyuki] Univ Hawaii, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Atmospher Sci, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Murakami, H (corresponding author), Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050052, Japan.",hir.murakami@gmail.com,"Murakami, Hiroyuki/L-5745-2015; Kitoh, Akio/F-1765-2010","Murakami, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1816-3452; ","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; MRI of Japan; Global Research Laboratory (GRL) Program of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) [2011-0021927]","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); MRI of Japan; Global Research Laboratory (GRL) Program of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST)","This work was conducted under the framework of the 'Projection of the Change in Future Weather Extremes Using Super-High-Resolution Atmospheric Models' supported by the KAKUSHIN and SOUSEI programmes of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.

The Aerosol Index (AI) from TOMS (1978-2005) and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from MISR spectroradiometer (2000-2010) indicate a higher-than-normal aerosol loading over the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) during the pre-monsoon season with a concurrent El Nio. Sensitivity experiments using ECHAM5-HAMMOZ climate model suggests that this enhanced loading of pre-monsoon absorbing aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic plain can reduce the drought during El Nio years by invoking the 'Elevated-Heat-Pump' mechanism through an anomalous aerosol-induced warm core in the atmospheric column. This anomalous heating upshot the relative strengthening of the cross-equatorial moisture inflow associated with the monsoon and eventually reduces the severity of drought during El Nio years. The findings are subject to the usual limitations such as the uncertainties in observations, and limited number of El Nio years (during the study period).","[Fadnavis, S.; Roy, Chaitri; Sabin, T.

Furthermore, a fraction of the thawed permafrost carbon is released as methane, enhancing the combined feedback strength. We present simulations with an inverted intermediate complexity climate model, which follows prescribed global warming pathways to stabilization at 1.5 or 2.0 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by the year 2100, and which incorporates a state-of-the-art global land surface model with updated descriptions of wet-land and permafrost carbon release. We demonstrate that the climate feedbacks from those two processes are substantial. Specifically, permissible anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 emission budgets are reduced by 17-23% (47-56 GtC) for stabilization at 1.5 degrees C, and 9-13% (52-57 GtC) for 2.0 degrees C stabilization. In our simulations these feedback processes respond more quickly at temperatures below 1.5 degrees C, and the differences between the 1.5 and 2 degrees C targets are disproportionately small. This key finding holds for transient emission pathways to 2100 and does not account for longer-term implications of these feedback processes. We conclude that natural feedback processes from wetlands and permafrost must be considered in assessments of transient emission pathways to limit global warming.","[Comyn-Platt, Edward; Hayman, Garry; Huntingford, Chris] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Chadburn, Sarah E.] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Chadburn, Sarah E.; Harper, Anna B.; Powell, Tom; Cox, Peter M.; Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Burke, Eleanor J.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Collins, William J.; Webber, Christopher P.] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England; [Gedney, Nicola] Joint Ctr Hydrometeorol Res, Met Off Hadley Ctr, Wallingford, Oxon, England",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); University of Leeds; University of Exeter; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; University of Reading; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Comyn-Platt, E (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England.",edwcom@ceh.ac.uk,"Collins, William/A-5895-2010; , Eleanor/AAK-2698-2020; Hayman, Garry D/J-7044-2012; Huntingford, Christopher/A-4307-2008; Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Cox, Peter Michae;/B-3299-2012","Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; Hayman, Garry D/0000-0003-3825-4156; Huntingford, Christopher/0000-0002-5941-7770; Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; Cox, Peter Michae;/0000-0002-0679-2219; Comyn-Platt, Edward/0000-0001-7821-4998; Harper, Anna/0000-0001-7294-6039; Chadburn, Sarah/0000-0003-1320-315X","UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/P015050/1 CLIFFTOP, NE/P014909/1, MOC1.5, NE/P014941/1 CLUES]; Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; CRESCENDO (EU) [641816]; EPSRC Fellowship 'Negative Emissions and the Food-Energy-Water Nexus' [EP/N030141/1]; CEH National Capability Funding; EPSRC [EP/N030141/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [ceh020006, NE/P014909/1, NE/P014941/1, NE/H000224/1, NE/P015050/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H000224/1, NE/P015050/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Joint UK BEIS/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme; CRESCENDO (EU)(European Commission); EPSRC Fellowship 'Negative Emissions and the Food-Energy-Water Nexus'(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); CEH National Capability Funding; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was undertaken as part of the UK Natural Environment Research Council's programme 'Understanding the Pathways to and Impacts of a 1.5 degrees C Rise in Global Temperature' through grants NE/P015050/1 CLIFFTOP (to E.C.-P., G.H. and S.E.C.), NE/P014909/1, MOC1.5 (to W.J.C., C.P.W., C.H., P.M.C. and S.S.) and NE/P014941/1 CLUES (to A.B.H., P.M.C. and T.P.).

Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens pose serious threats to healthcare and human capital. If the increasing rate of AMR is left uncontrolled, it is estimated that it will lead to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. This global epidemic of AMR necessitates radical interdisciplinary solutions to better detect antimicrobial susceptibility and manage infections. Rapid diagnostics that can identify antimicrobial-resistant pathogens to assist clinicians and health workers in initiating appropriate treatment are critical for antimicrobial stewardship. In this review, we summarize different technologies applied for the development of rapid diagnostics for AMR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). We briefly describe the single-cell technologies that were developed to hasten the AST of infectious pathogens. Then, the different types of genotypic and phenotypic techniques and the commercially available rapid diagnostics for AMR are discussed in detail. We conclude by addressing the potential of current rapid diagnostic systems being developed as point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools and the challenges to adapt them at the POC level. Overall, this review provides an insight into the current status of rapid and POC diagnostic systems for AMR.","[Shanmugakani, Rathina Kumar; Srinivasan, Balaji; Erickson, David; Mehta, Saurabh] Cornell Univ, Inst Nutr Sci Global Hlth & Technol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Shanmugakani, Rathina Kumar; Srinivasan, Balaji; Erickson, David; Mehta, Saurabh] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Glesby, Marshall J.; Westblade, Lars F.] Weill Cornell Med, Div Infect Dis, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Westblade, Lars F.] Weill Cornell Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, New York, NY USA; [Cardenas, Washington B.] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, Lab Invest Biomed, Guayaquil, Guayas, Ecuador; [Raj, Tony] St Johns Res Inst, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Erickson, David] Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Shanmugakani, Rathina Kumar] Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, Charlottesville, VA USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral; St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences; St. John's Research Institute; Cornell University; University of Virginia,"Erickson, D; Mehta, S (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Inst Nutr Sci Global Hlth & Technol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Erickson, D; Mehta, S (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Erickson, D (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sibley Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",de54@cornell.edu; smehta@cornell.edu,"Mehta, Saurabh/L-8490-2017","Mehta, Saurabh/0000-0003-3788-0665; Shanmuga Kani, Rathina Kumar/0000-0002-2646-6672",National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health [R01EB021331]; Clinical and Translational Science Center at Weill Cornell Medicine through NIH/NCATS [UL1TR002384]; Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University,National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); Clinical and Translational Science Center at Weill Cornell Medicine through NIH/NCATS; Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University,"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01EB021331, the Clinical and Translational Science Center at Weill Cornell Medicine through NIH/NCATS UL1TR002384, and the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University.

Here, we use a combination of hydrologic models of catchment streamflow, lake energy balance, and lake water balance to simulate lake level at Little Windy Hill Pond (LWH) in the Medicine Bow Range of Wyoming for a period of severe drought during the mid-Holocene (MH; approximately 6000years ago). Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) output to drive our hydrologic models, we find that none of our simulations reproduce the significantly lowered lake levels at LWH during the MH. Rather, simulated hydroclimate changes for the MH are modest (<10% reductions in precipitation and streamflow and generally 10-30% increases in lake evaporation), and LWH lake-level changes are buffered by the large volume of snowmelt runoff that the lake receives. Only when winter precipitation is approximately halved in sensitivity experiments do water inputs to the lake become small enough that lake level can be significantly drawn down by year-over-year negative water balances. Possible explanations for the model-data mismatch could lie in the realism of our hydrological modeling framework or in the accuracy of the CMIP5 output, the latter having important implications for projections of future drying in western North America.","[Morrill, Carrie; Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Morrill, Carrie] NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Meador, Evelyn] Univ Oregon, Earth Sci Dept, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Liefert, David T.; Shuman, Bryan N.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Geol & Geophys, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Oregon; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Wyoming,"Morrill, C (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Morrill, C (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Ctr Environm Informat, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",carrie.morrill@colorado.edu,"Livneh, Ben/I-2939-2015","Livneh, Ben/0000-0001-5445-2473; Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925; Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office [NA17OAR4320101]; NOAA Hollings Program,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Hollings Program,We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modeling and the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project for CMIP/PMIP model output.

The present work compares the environmental performance of two scenarios: a solar thermal system for providing domestic hot water (DHW) used in conjunction with a traditional natural gas heating system, and the natural gas heating system on its own. Weak points are found and different eco-design scenarios are evaluated in order to achieve a more circular economy. In addition, the authors explore what would be the national Greenhouse Gas emission reduction potential of a wider use of domestic solar hot water systems (DSHW) in China's and Spain's built environment. In this case, five displacement methods are suggested to show how the emissions reduction vary. Through a review of the state of the art and a Life Cycle Assessment of a solar system the two scenarios are assessed. Some impact categories, such as global warming, suggest a markedly better performance of the solar system (-65%). However, weak points in the solar solution have been identified as there is an increase of impacts in cases such as acidification (+6%) and eutrophication (+61%), mostly due to the metals used. The components with higher environmental impact are the collector, the tank, and the copper tubes. The reduction of national emissions by promoting DSHW depends on the actual displaced technology/ies. The consequences on national emissions reduction depending on these choices are assessed. The potential reduction of emissions, if 30% of the DHW were covered with solar sources, would be between 0.38% and 0.50% in the case of Spain and between 0.12% and 0.63% in China.","[Alberti, Jaume; Raigosa, Juliana; Raugei, Marco; Assiego, Rafael; Ribas-Tur, Joan; Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere] Univ Pompeu Fabra, UNESCO Chair Life Cycle & Climate Change, ESCI, Pg Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Raigosa, Juliana] Minist Informat & Commun Technol, Innovat Ctr E Govt, Bogota, Colombia; [Raugei, Marco] Oxford Brookes Univ, Fac Technol Design & Environm, Wheatley Campus, Oxford OX33 1HX, England; [Assiego, Rafael] Energy Grp Univ Malaga, ETS Arquitectura, Pl Ejido S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain; [Ribas-Tur, Joan] Univ Pompeu Fabra, RISE, ESCI, Passeig Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Garrido-Soriano, Maria] UPC, Sustainabil Measurement & Modeling Lab, Sch Ind Aeroespace & Audiovisual Engn Terrassa, Colom St, Barcelona 08222, Spain; [Zhang, Linghui; Song, Guobao] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, Key Lab Ind Ecol & Environm Engn MOE, 2 Linggong Rd, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Hernandez, Patxi] Tecnalia, E-20730 Azpeitia, Gipuzkoa, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Oxford Brookes University; Pompeu Fabra University; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Dalian University of Technology,"Alberti, J (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, UNESCO Chair Life Cycle & Climate Change, ESCI, Pg Pujades 1, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",jaume.alberti@esci.upf.edu,"Raugei, Marco/N-4737-2015; Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere/J-6174-2013; Song, Guobao/AAI-6927-2020; Garrido Soriano, Nuria/L-4512-2014","Raugei, Marco/0000-0001-5026-8556; Fullana-i-Palmer, Pere/0000-0003-0013-5098; Garrido Soriano, Nuria/0000-0002-3606-3199; RIbas-Tur, Joan/0000-0002-2492-0464; Alberti, Jaume/0000-0002-8026-0835; Song, Guobao/0000-0002-4862-4192","UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change at ESCI-UPF; Spanish Government, through the National Plan for Scientific Research, Development and Technological Innovation; European Regional Development Fund of the European Commission","UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change at ESCI-UPF; Spanish Government, through the National Plan for Scientific Research, Development and Technological Innovation; European Regional Development Fund of the European Commission","One of the authors (Alberti) wishes to thank the UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change at ESCI-UPF for funding his PhD thesis, which this paper comprises part of.

These processes allow access to new areas for shipping and the installation of structures. However, the occurring changes are not solely a reduction of ice, but also waves increasingly occur in cold regions contributing to ice break up in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the transport of ice towards the open sea. Much work has been done to combine the single topic disciplines: wave-hydrodynamics, ice mechanics and structure mechanics to wave-structure (WSI) and ice-structure interaction (ISI). The changing environment in cold regions and the increased wave activity form a new combined discipline: wave-ice-structure interaction (WISI). This paper addresses existing knowledge gaps of the future loading scenario WISI that need to be addressed in engineering to ensure safety for future operations in Polar Regions. The knowledge gaps however, do not only refer to the discipline interfaces, i.e. challenges in combining them, but also to knowledge gaps within them. Wave statistics and the cross-effect between wave and ice are widely unknown which limits the definition of a design wave scenario, Structures in such environments are exposed to subzero temperatures and neither their impact on properties nor on fatigue life is fully understood. While most phenomena of these two disciplines and their implementation into numerical models are established the ice mechanics appear as the weakest link. Ice is a complex material and not all aspects of its mechanical behaviour are understood and if the implementation into (numerical) models has not been successful yet. Ice pieces that are energetically charged by waves and collide with structures at high velocities and for such high impact loads the governing ice mechanics are hardly covered by the state of the art or not at all.","[von Bock, R.

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud resolving models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.","[Stephens, Graeme L.; L'Ecuyer, Tristan; Suzuki, Kentaroh; Gabriel, Philip] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bodas-Salcedo, Alejandro] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Forbes, Richard] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Gettelman, Andrew] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Golaz, Jean-Christophe] Princeton Univ, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ 08542 USA; [Haynes, John] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Colorado State University; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; Monash University,"Stephens, GL (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Gettelman, Andrew/AAY-2312-2021; L'Ecuyer, Tristan S/C-7040-2013; Suzuki, Kentaroh/C-3624-2011; Golaz, Jean-Christophe/D-5007-2014; L'Ecuyer, Tristan S/E-5607-2012","Golaz, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-1616-5435; L'Ecuyer, Tristan S/0000-0002-7584-4836; Forbes, Richard/0000-0002-3596-8287; Suzuki, Kentaroh/0000-0001-5315-2452",NASA [NAG5-11475]; NOAA [NA17RJ1228 193]; DECC/Defra [GA01101]; MEXT; JST,"NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); DECC/Defra(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST))","Aspects of this work have been supported both under NASA grant NAG5-11475 and NOAA grant NA17RJ1228 193.

There were disputes between them - regarding both the content and methods of teaching, as well as the prestige of the institutions and teachers employed in them. The competition at the symbolic level of two orders was also unitary - in the middle of the eighteenth century a dispute arose between two representatives of these orders: the Piarist Ubaldo Mignoni and the Jesuit Franciszek Bohomolec. Mignoni in his essay Noctium Sarmaticarum vigiliae used the concept of geographical determinism and climate theory to prove that not all peoples, including the peoples of the North (also the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), were capable of developing science and art at the highest level.

Yet, coastal zones host ecosystems that provide associated services which, therefore, may be lost due to coastal erosion. In this paper we assess to what extent past and future coastal erosion patterns lead to losses in land cover types and associated ecosystem service values. Hence, historical (based on CORINE land cover information) and projected (based on Dynamic and Interactive Vulnerability Assessment - DIVA - simulations) coastal erosion patterns are used in combination with a benefits transfer approach. DIVA projections are based on regionalized IPCC scenarios. Relative to the period 1975-2050, a case study is provided for selected European coastal country member states. For historical (1975-2006) coastal erosion trends, we observe territory losses in coastal agricultural, water body and forest & semi-natural areas - total coastal erosion equaling over 4,500 km(2). Corresponding coastal ecosystem service values decrease from about a,not sign22.3 billion per year in 1975 to about a,not sign21.6 billion per year in 2006. For future (2006-2050) coastal erosion projections, total territory losses equal between similar to 3,700 km(2) and similar to 5,800 km(2) - coastal wetland areas being affected most severely. Corresponding coastal ecosystem service values decrease to between a,not sign20.1 and a,not sign19.4 billion per year by 2050. Hence, we argue that the response strategy of EU member states to deal with coastal erosion and climate change impacts should be based on the economic as well as the ecological importance of their coastal zones.","[Roebeling, P.

Of particular importance is the ability to identify and track fast- and slow-moving processes associated with weathering, erosion and the movement or removal of heritage objects by natural and human agents. In this paper, the authors demonstrate how 3D laser scanning can be used to detect and monitor changes to the Okotoks Erratic Big Rock Provincial Historic Resource in Alberta, Canada, over a period of 7 years. Design/methodology/approach Terrestrial laser scanning surveys of the Okotoks Erratic Big Rock Provincial Historic Resource were undertaken in 2013, 2016 and 2020. Registration was used to place the three epochs of point clouds into a unique datum for comparison using the cloud-to-cloud distance function in Cloud Compare. Findings The movement/repositioning of rocks around the base of the erratic, the emergence of unofficial paths and changes to interpretive trails and fencing were all identified at the site over the time period of the study. Practical implications Current conservation at the Okotoks Big Rock focus primarily on the rock art panels that are scattered over the erratic. The results of this study indicate they should be broadened so that the geological integrity of the site, which is intrinsically linked to its cultural value, can also be maintained. Originality/value This is the first study the authors are aware of that utilizes terrestrial laser scanning + change detection analysis to identify and track changes to a heritage site over a period as long as 7 years.","[Dawson, Peter] Univ Calgary, Fac Arts, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Brink, Jack] Royal Alberta Museum, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Farrokhi, Alireza] Govt Alberta, Minist Culture & Status Women, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Jia, Fengman; Lichti, Derek] Univ Calgary, Fac Engn, Dept Geomat Engn, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Dawson, P (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Arts, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Calgary, AB, Canada.",pcdawson@ucalgary.ca,,"Dawson, Peter/0000-0002-5090-6391",,,,,47,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2044-1266,2044-1274,,J CULT HERIT MANAG S,J.

The digital twins, takes the intake air on characteristics, i.e., temperature, relative humidity as well as main operating and design parameters, i.e., intake air velocity, working air fraction, height of HMX, channel gap, and number of layers as the inputs. GIDPC's cooling capacity, coefficient of performance (COP), dew point efficiency, wet-bulb efficiency, supply air temperature and surface area of the layers are selected as outputs. The optimum values of aforementioned operating and design parameters are identified by the MOEO to maximise the cooling capacity, COP, wet-bulb efficiencies and to minimise the surface area of the layers in four identified climates within Koppen-Geiger climate classification, namely: tropical rainforest, arid, Mediterranean hot summer and hot summer continental climates. The system monthly and annual performances in the identified optimum conditions are compared with the base system and the results show the annual improvements of up to 72.75% in COP and 23.57% in surface area. In addition, the annual power consumption is reduced by up to 49.41% when the system is designed and operated optimally. It is concluded that identifying the optimum conditions for the GIDPC can increase the system performance substantially.","[Akhlaghi, Yousef Golizadeh; Badiei, Ali; Zhao, Xudong; Xiao, Xin; Shittu, Samson; Ma, Xiaoli] Univ Hull, Ctr Sustainable Energy Technol, Energy & Environm Inst, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Aslansefat, Koorosh] Univ Hull, Dept Comp Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Hull; University of Hull,"Zhao, XD; Xiao, X (corresponding author), Univ Hull, Ctr Sustainable Energy Technol, Energy & Environm Inst, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",Xudong.Zhao@hull.ac.uk; X.Xiao@hull.ac.uk,"Shittu, Samson/AAE-8353-2019; Zhao, Xudong/AAY-4833-2020; Aslansefat, Koorosh/T-7792-2018","Shittu, Samson/0000-0002-4190-2663; Zhao, Xudong/0000-0002-6521-7054; Aslansefat, Koorosh/0000-0001-9318-8177; Badiei, Ali/0000-0002-2103-2955",European Commission H2020 MSCA programme (EU H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016-734340 DEW-COOL-4-CDC project); National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFE0133300]; UK BEIS project IEEA2021; EPSRC [EP/M507830/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Commission H2020 MSCA programme (EU H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016-734340 DEW-COOL-4-CDC project); National Key R&D Program of China; UK BEIS project IEEA2021; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"The authors would acknowledge our sincere appreciation to the financial supports from the European Commission H2020 MSCA programme (for the EU H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016-734340 DEW-COOL-4-CDC project), the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFE0133300) and UK BEIS project IEEA2021.",,50,17,17,2,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

Cities have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions as most of the traffic, industry, commerce and more than 50% of world population is situated in urban areas. Southern Europe is a region that faces financial turmoil, enhanced migratory fluxes and climate change pressure. The case study of Thessaloniki is presented, one of the only two cities in Greece with established climate change action plans. The effects of feasible traffic policies in year 2020 are assessed and their potential health impact is compared to a business as usual scenario. Two types of measures are investigated: operation of underground rail in the city centre and changes in fleet composition. Potential co-benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions on public health by the year 2020 are computed utilizing state-of-the-art concentration response functions for PMx, NO2 and C6H6. Results show significant environmental health and monetary co-benefits when the city metro is coupled with appropriate changes in the traffic composition. Monetary savings due to avoided mortality or leukaemia incidence corresponding to the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure will be 56.6, 45, 37.7 and 1.0 million Euros respectively. Promotion of 'green' transportation in the city (i.e. the wide use of electric vehicles), will provide monetary savings from the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure up to 60.4, 49.1, 41.2 and 1.08 million Euros. Overall, it was shown that the respective GHG emission reduction policies resulted in clear co-benefits in terms of air quality improvement, public health protection and monetary loss mitigation.

The Mundafan palaeolake is situated in southern Saudi Arabia, in the Rub' al-Khali (the 'Empty Quarter'), the world's largest sand desert. Here we report the first discoveries of Middle Palaeolithic and Neolithic archaeological sites in association with the palaeolake. We associate the human occupations with new geochronological data, and suggest the archaeological sites date to the wet periods of Marine Isotope Stage 5 and the Early Holocene. The archaeological sites indicate that humans repeatedly penetrated the ameliorated environments of the Rub' al-Khali. The sites probably represent short-term occupations, with the Neolithic sites focused on hunting, as indicated by points and weaponry. Middle Palaeolithic assemblages at Mundafan support a lacustrine adaptive focus in Arabia. Provenancing of obsidian artifacts indicates that Neolithic groups at Mundafan had a wide wandering range, with transport of artifacts from distant sources.","[Crassard, Remy; Khalidi, Lamya] Maison Orient & Mediterranee, CNRS, UMR Archeorient 5133, Lyon, France; [Petraglia, Michael D.; Groucutt, Huw S.] Univ Oxford, Sch Archaeol, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford, England; [Petraglia, Michael D.] Smithsonian Inst, Human Origins Program, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Drake, Nick A.; Breeze, Paul] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Gratuze, Bernard] Ctr Ernest Babelon, CNRS, UMR Iramat 5060, Orleans, France; [Alsharekh, Abdullah] King Saud Univ, Coll Tourism & Archaeol, Dept Archaeol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Alsharekh, Abdullah] Minist Higher Educ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Arbach, Mounir; Robin, Christian J.; Schiettecatte, Jeremie] CNRS, UMR Orient & Mediterranee Mondes Semit 8167, Ivry, France; [Michelsen, Nils] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Angew Geowissensch, Darmstadt, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Oxford; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; University of London; King's College London; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); King Saud University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Technical University of Darmstadt,"Crassard, R (corresponding author), Maison Orient & Mediterranee, CNRS, UMR Archeorient 5133, Lyon, France.",remy.crassard@mom.fr,"Gratuze, Bernard/P-4002-2019; Parker, Adrian/T-3421-2019; Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021; Jacobs, Zenobia/B-2721-2012; Roberts, Richard Graham/B-8245-2013; Groucutt, Huw/GNM-5500-2022; Schiettecatte, Jérémie/AAX-3403-2020; Alsharekh, Abdullah M/AAH-3718-2019; Parker, Adrian/X-2596-2019","Gratuze, Bernard/0000-0001-6136-8085; Parker, Adrian/0000-0003-2989-7344; Jacobs, Zenobia/0000-0001-5424-5837; Roberts, Richard Graham/0000-0002-0128-4119; Schiettecatte, Jérémie/0000-0001-6691-5922; Jennings, Richard/0000-0001-9996-7518; Khalidi, Lamya/0000-0003-1205-7525; Hilbert, Yamandu/0000-0002-5469-2933; Crassard, Remy/0000-0002-2403-1894; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727",French Embassy in Saudi Arabia; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Fondation Fyssen grant 'Subvention de Recherche; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J500306/1]; European Research Council [295719]; IRAMAT- Universite d'Orleans - UTBM; CEPAM - Universite de Nice Sophia-Antipolis; CRAHM - Universite de Caen; CAA - Universite de Rennes,French Embassy in Saudi Arabia; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Fondation Fyssen grant 'Subvention de Recherche; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); IRAMAT- Universite d'Orleans - UTBM; CEPAM - Universite de Nice Sophia-Antipolis; CRAHM - Universite de Caen; CAA - Universite de Rennes,"This research was funded by the French Embassy in Saudi Arabia (to CJR), the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (to CJR), the Fondation Fyssen grant 'Subvention de Recherche 2013' (to RC), the Natural Environment Research Council grant no.

As ice sheet SMB varies highly across multiple scales of space (meters to hundreds of kilometers) and time (hourly to decadal), it is notoriously challenging to observe and represent in models. In addition, SMB consists of multiple components, all of which depend on complex interactions between the atmosphere and the snow/ice surface, large-scale atmospheric circulation and ocean conditions, and ice sheet topography. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge and recent advances in ice sheet SMB observations and models, highlight current shortcomings, and propose future directions. Novel observational methods allow mapping SMB across larger areas, longer time periods, and/or at very high (subdaily) temporal frequency. As a recent observational breakthrough, cosmic ray counters provide direct estimates of SMB, circumventing the need for accurate snow density observations upon which many other techniques rely. Regional atmospheric climate models have drastically improved their simulation of ice sheet SMB in the last decade, thanks to the inclusion or improved representation of essential processes (e.g., clouds, blowing snow, and snow albedo), and by enhancing horizontal resolution (5-30 km). Future modeling efforts are required in improving Earth system models to match regional atmospheric climate model performance in simulating ice sheet SMB, and in reinforcing the efforts in developing statistical and dynamic downscaling to represent smaller-scale SMB processes.","[Lenaerts, Jan T.

Here we show that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) correlates with the occurrence of catastrophic floods across Europe and the associated economic losses. The analysis reveals that in Northern Europe the majority of historic winter floods occurred during a positive NAO state, whereas the majority of summer floods occurred during a negative state. Analogous, but stronger, patterns can be observed in individual Atlantic countries. Through the application of a state-of-the-art catastrophe model, we find that there is a statistically significant relationship between the NAO and flood losses. Critically, we observe that the average flood loss during opposite NAO states can differ by up to 50%. These results can inform financial preparedness and disaster fund allocation, as stakeholders, such as governments and insurance companies, can distribute resources more effectively. Plain Language Summary Increasing flood exposure and alarming climate change scenarios are responsible for growing concerns about economic losses from future floods. While it is well known that large-scale climatic patterns control meteorological events, it is not always clear whether this connection can be extended to the occurrence of flood events and the associated losses. In this study, based on the analysis of recent flood databases and the application of a catastrophe model, we show that there is indeed a significant relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and flood losses. The use of a model allows to quantify the impact of the NAO on flood losses and to show that average flood losses vary significantly across opposite NAO states. The study shows that the NAO index constitutes a meaningful predictor for long-term average losses. In particular, based on recent development in NAO predictability, we argue that temporal variability of flood risk, due to climatic oscillations, can be predicted in advance, allowing for mitigation measures to take place sooner and enhance resiliency to flood hazard.","[Zanardo, Stefano; Nicotina, Ludovico; Hilberts, Arno G.

The coverage of deep-convective clouds increases with stronger upward motion, but the proportion of thick, medium, and thin anvil cloud remains nearly constant. Thus, when averaging over scales larger than individual storms, the top-of-atmosphere net radiation is only weakly sensitive to the large-scale flow. The balance in cloud radiative effects is therefore maintained across a wide range of large-scale circulations. The ability of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 to reproduce the observed cloud-circulation relationships is investigated. The simulated convective clouds substantially overestimate the proportion of deep and optically thick cloud and underestimate the proportion of anvil cirrus. These results demonstrate that simulating key properties of deep-convective clouds remains challenging for some state-of-the-art climate models. Plain Language Summary The high-cloud systems that are found over warm tropical oceans typically contain thick, rainy clouds connected to thinner extended ice clouds. The thick clouds have a cooling effect on Earth's climate because of their ability to reflect incoming sunlight back to space, while the thin clouds have a warming effect because of their ability to trap outgoing thermal infrared radiation. These warming and cooling effects cancel one another very closely, but why they do so is unknown. In this study we use satellite data to show that the cancellation is maintained as the large-scale atmospheric circulation varies. We also show that a state-of-the-art climate model does not reproduce this behavior.","[Wall, Casey J.; Hartmann, Dennis L.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wall, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",caseyw8@uw.edu,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Hartmann, Dennis/0000-0002-4495-7774; Wall, Casey/0000-0001-7682-5576",Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0012580]; National Science Foundation,Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the Regional and Global Climate Modeling Program of the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy (grant DE-SC0012580).

It has been postulated that these trends are associated with the enhanced levels of atmospheric CO2. In this context, it is natural to ask how continuing rising levels of CO2 may affect the climate in the future. The past IPCC reports have documented numerous studies where increased greenhouse gas concentrations have been prescribed in global climate model simulations. Now, new simulations with state-of-the-art climate models are becoming available for the next IPCC report [the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)], and results from a number of these simulations are examined in order to determine whether they indicate a change in extreme precipitation on a monthly basis. The analysis involves a simple record-statistics framework and shows that the upper tails of the probability distribution functions for monthly precipitation are being stretched in the mid- and high latitudes where mean-level precipitation increases have already been reported in the past. In other words, values corresponding to extreme monthly precipitation in the past are, according to these results, becoming more frequent.","Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Benestad, RE (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",rasmus.benestad@met.no,"Benestad, Rasmus E./I-3156-2019","Benestad, Rasmus E./0000-0002-5969-4508",,,,,29,28,28,1,4,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Yet, despite attempts by governments and international organisations at addressing these challenges, they remain unabated. Understanding the challenges through a resilience lens can support actions for addressing these impacts. Regardless of this potential, the application of urban resilience to sustainable urban environments remains a distant reality in areas most vulnerable to the impacts of these environmental and health threats. Understanding of the application of the resilience concept to urban development and its outcomes are limited in Ghana. This study fills this gap by focusing on: the extent of climate change in the city of Kumasi; local experiences of major unplanned urban growth challenges in Kumasi; local understanding of urban resilience; and efforts towards urban resilience. Using institutional interviews and household surveys, findings indicate a rising trend of temperature and unpredictable rainfall pattern in Kumasi. This situation is generating negative consequences such as flooding, destruction of ecologically sensitive areas, and related diseases such as malaria. Complicating matters further are the impacts of unplanned urban growth, including poor sanitation conditions, inadequate social services, and poor housing conditions. Unfortunately, despite these challenges, there is limited understanding of urban resilience in Kumasi, amongst both urban planning related institutions and local communities. As a consequence, institutional initiatives towards urban resilience are uncoordinated and incomprehensive.","[Darkwah, Rhoda Mensah; Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful; Anokye, Prince Aboagye] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Art & Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana; [Cobbinah, Patrick Brandful] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Charles Sturt University,"Cobbinah, PB (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Art & Built Environm, Dept Planning, Kumasi, Ghana.",pcobbinah@csu.edu.au,"Cobbinah, Patrick/ABH-9950-2020","Cobbinah, Patrick/0000-0003-2522-9293; Darkwah, Rhoda Mensah/0000-0003-0335-7008",,,,,56,13,13,4,26,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-7185,1872-9398,,GEOFORUM,Geoforum,AUG,2018,,,,,12,23,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.05.023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.05.023,,,12,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,GN9QB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000439537900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Architecture van Brandenburg is interested in current notions around biomimicry or the referencing of natural forms in building or other art forms. Their practice is set up as a kind of ecology wherein participants move organically between the different arts: architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics. They identify with the work of Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926) in his use of organic forms and also in his use of waste materials for the finishing of form. Their interest in the use of recycled materials plays out within the current context of an era of waste crisis. As was the case with Gaudi, their finishes are highly ornamental and do not adhere to modernist ideas around the simplification of surfaces, as, for example, expounded by Adolf Loos in the 1920s. In the current climate of awareness around issues of sustainability, Architecture van Brandenburg finds a community of practice in the work of many other architects focusing on recycling of waste, examples being McDowell Espinosa in the USA and Superuse in the Netherlands.","[Schmidt, Leoni] Otago Polytech, Dunedin Sch Art, Dunedin, New Zealand",Otago Polytechnic,"Schmidt, L (corresponding author), Otago Polytech, Dunedin Sch Art, Dunedin, New Zealand.",leoni.schmidt@op.ac.nz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG,PRETORIA,"ART HISTORICAL WORK GROUP SOUTH AFRICA-AHWG, PRETORIA, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-3542,,,SOUTH AFR J ART HIST,South Afr.

It presents a sharp contrast with environmentally focused, avant-garde smog art. Although avant-garde smog art is in line with today's scientific correctness by virtue of its strong commitment to activism, I believe that everyday smog life, which is viewed either as ecoambiguous or as smog Ah-Q, is in effect more subversive than its avant-garde smog art counterpart. What has undergirded smog life is a collective ecological unconsciousnessthe premodern mist consciousnessthat is suppressed in smog modernity, of which scientific discourse pertaining to topics such as toxic smog (mai) has become the predominant way of conceptualizing air. The author reads this suppressed mist (wu) or qi consciousness as a form of resistance against the current scientific-corrective discourse and scientism. If we situate smog life in the context of how traditional Chinese culture has been systematically marginalized in the imperialization of technological modernity, today's air-pollution-induced smog life is in actuality an invitation to explore other cognitive possibilities for air beyond the scientific. The hidden ecological consciousness and its discourse help subvert the cyberization of life and the legitimacy of an exclusive scientific epistemology as the only means of knowing.","[Chang, Chia-Ju] CUNY, Brooklyn Coll, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Brooklyn College (CUNY),"Chang, CJ (corresponding author), CUNY, Brooklyn Coll, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA.",,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,1,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",2578-3491,2578-3505,,PRISM-THEOR MOD CHIN,Prism-Theor.

This study synthesizes 40 years of scientific evidence of what may be an important benefit of these commitments: the non-use value of biodiversity conservation. The synthesis investigates whether biodiversity values can be integrated into climate change damage estimates based on non-use valuation studies of different threats to biodiversity. In the absence of estimates of public willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid the adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change on biodiversity, we synthesize non-use values for biodiversity conservation from stated preference studies that account for a heterogeneous set of biodiversity threats. We test whether biodiversity non-use values are affected by the threats that policies aim to address, be it human activities or other threats. We estimate meta-regression models in which we explain the variation in these non-use values by accounting for the observed heterogeneity in good, methodology, sample, and context characteristics. We estimate meta-regression models using 159 observations from 62 publications. The models suggest that non-use values for biodiversity conservation addressing human impacts may be larger than those addressing other threats. We also find that non-use values are generally not sensitive to which biodiversity indicators, habitat types, or taxonomic groups are valued. We predict that the mean annual WTP for avoiding human-caused biodiversity losses ranges from 0.2 to 0.4% of GDP per capita. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art climate change damage functions in integrated assessment models may underestimate actual damage costs because they do not incorporate the premium that the public is willing to pay to avoid human-caused biodiversity losses.","[Nobel, Anne; Lizin, Sebastien; Bruns, Stephan B.; Malina, Robert] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Brouwer, Roy] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Bruns, Stephan B.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Stern, David, I] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia; [Malina, Robert] MIT, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Lab Aviat & Environm, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Hasselt University; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; University of Gottingen; Australian National University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Nobel, A (corresponding author), Hasselt Univ, Ctr Environm Sci, Martelarenlaan 42, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium.",anne.nobel@uhasselt.be,"Stern, David I/B-4700-2009; Lizin, Sebastien/AGF-1544-2022; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Stern, David I/0000-0001-6595-4268; Lizin, Sebastien/0000-0002-3320-6406; Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050; Nobel, Anne/0000-0003-2460-8566","Research Foundation Flanders [11G2319N, 12G5418N]",Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),"AN and SL are funded by fellowships of the Research Foundation Flanders (11G2319N and 12G5418N, respectively).",,152,7,7,8,32,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The resulting increase in forecasting accuracy and atmospheric model development utilizing this hyperspectral data is demonstrated by the uplooking data. The GIFTS sensor is an imaging FTS with programmable spectral resolution and spatial scene selection, allowing spectral resolution and area coverage to be traded in near-real time. Due to funding limitations, the GIFTS sensor module was completed as an engineering demonstration unit that can be upgraded to flight quality. This paper reviews the GIFTS system design considerations and the technology utilized to enable a nearly two order performance increase over the existing GOES sounder and shows its capability.

Bacterial spread may also occur in dry and warm weather conditions when humans and animals are forced to share depleted water sources. In such settings, farm animals such as beef cattle, which may be present in large numbers in natural water sources, can play a major role in disease spread. However, the risk factors for their infection and the potential control measures to prevent the disease spread have not been adequately studied. In the face of an emerging human leptospirosis outbreak in the dry and warm Israeli 2018 summer, we tested seropositivity to Leptospira serovar Pomona in grazing beef cattle and wild boars located in proximity to the contaminated streams. Additionally, we used the natural setting of the outbreak to identify risk factors for seropositivity in beef cattle. We found high seropositivity to serovar Pomona in grazing beef cattle (233/845), and in wild boars (7/13). Seropositivity was significantly associated with beef cattle drinking from natural water sources compared to beef cattle drinking from water troughs with fresh water supply (Multivariable logistic regression; odds ratio = 18.6, 95% confidence interval = 3-116, p-value < 0.01). One Health approach is necessary for mitigating zoonotic Leptospira infections, in which interactions between humans, animals, and the environment play a major role. As the global warming crisis results in severe climate changes, dry and warm weather conditions may become more common worldwide. Under such conditions, reducing inter-species interactions in contaminated natural water sources is essential for protecting public health. Our study demonstrates the role of natural water as a source for beef cattle infection and disease spread. Furthermore, we suggest using water troughs with freshwater supply for preventing future outbreaks in animals and humans in such settings.","[Zamir, Lior; Markovich, Michal Perry; Hamad, Fares; Even-Tov, Boris] Vet Serv & Anim Hlth, Bayit Dagan, Israel; [Baum, Miri; Bardenstein, Svetlana; Blum, Shlomo E.] Kimron Vet Inst, Bacteriol Dept, Bet Dagan, Israel; [Moran-Gilad, Jacob] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Beer Sheva, Israel; [King, Roni] Israel Nat & Pk Author, Jerusalem, Israel; [Markovich, Michal Perry; Lapid, Roi; Elnekave, Ehud] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Koret Sch Vet Med, Jerusalem, Israel",Kimron Veterinary Institute; Ben Gurion University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Elnekave, E (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Koret Sch Vet Med, Jerusalem, Israel.",ehud.elnekave@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Elnekave, Ehud/0000-0003-3354-7144",,,,,33,2,2,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7714,,ONE HEALTH-AMSTERDAM,One Health,JUN,2022,,,,,,,100372,10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100372,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100372,,,6,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",1V8XI,35146111,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000806368500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three state-of-the-art atmospheric models are run with prescribed SST anomalies representative of a strong ENSO event, with symmetric patterns for El Nino and La Nina. The well-known temperature perturbation in the lower stratosphere during El Nino is captured by two models, in which the anomalous warming at polar latitudes is accompanied by a positive geopotential height anomaly that extends over the polar cap. In the third model, which shows a lack of temperature anomalies over the pole, the anomalous anticyclone is confined over Canada and does not expand to the polar cap. This anomalous center of action emerges from the large-scale tropospheric Rossby wave train forced by ENSO, and shrinking/stretching around the polar vortex is invoked to link it to the temperature response. No disagreement across models is found in the lower stratosphere for La Nina, whose teleconnection is opposite in sign but weaker. In the middle-upper stratosphere (above 50 hPa) the geopotential height anomalies project on a wavenumber-1 (WN1) pattern for both El Nino and, more weakly, La Nina, and show a westward tilt with height up to the stratopause. It is suggested that this WN1 pattern arises from the high-latitude lower-stratospheric anomalies, and that the ENSO teleconnection to the polar stratosphere can be interpreted in terms of upward propagation of the stationary Rossby wave train and quasi-geostrophic balance, instead of wave breaking.","[Mezzina, Bianca; Garcia-Serrano, Javier] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain; [Palmeiro, Froila M.; Garcia-Serrano, Javier; Blade, Ileana] Univ Barcelona UB, Grp Meteorol, Barcelona, Spain; [Batte, Lauriane] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France; [Benassi, Marianna] Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); University of Barcelona; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Universite de Toulouse,"Mezzina, B (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr BSC, Barcelona, Spain.",bianca.mezzina@bsc.es,"García-Serrano, Javier/I-5058-2015; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015","García-Serrano, Javier/0000-0003-3913-0876; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Mezzina, Bianca/0000-0002-1264-815X; Batte, Lauriane/0000-0002-7903-9762; Benassi, Marianna/0000-0001-9196-6887",MEDSCOPE project; AEMET (ES); ANR (FR); BSC (ES); CMCC (IT); CNR (IT); IMR (BE); Meteo-France (FR); European Union [690462]; Contratos Predoctorales para la Formacion de Doctores programme [BES-2016-076431]; Ramon y Cajal programme [RYC-2016-21181]; Spanish DANAE project [CGL2015-68342-R]; Spanish GRAVITOCAST project [ERC2018-092835],MEDSCOPE project; AEMET (ES); ANR (FR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); BSC (ES); CMCC (IT); CNR (IT); IMR (BE); Meteo-France (FR); European Union(European Commission); Contratos Predoctorales para la Formacion de Doctores programme; Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government); Spanish DANAE project; Spanish GRAVITOCAST project,"This work was supported by the MEDSCOPE project.

This popular model - co-production - has advanced thinking on how to create usable knowledge. In practice, however, co-production has not been a single approach, but instead a diversity of forms of engaged research.

In this context, the global bioenergy market has grown massively during the last few decades. In addition, under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, 162 countries have already submitted their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to mitigate climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions pledges and action plans. Hence, the effect of these GHG restrictions on the bioenergy sector in the new expected global decarbonized energy system needs to be addressed. In this study, we estimate what role the international climate agreement could play in bioenergy sector expansion using the bottom-up energy system optimization model, TIAM-FR, a TIMES family model from ETSAP/IEA. As results, GHG restrictions promoted global bioenergy supply over the time horizon 2010-2050. In 2050, global biomass supply reaches 131-138 EJ under these climate scenarios, which is more than double biomass supply in the BAU scenario (60 EJ). In final bioenergy consumption, in 2050, only 3-5 EJ is consumed as biofuel in transport sector while 60 EJ of biomass is consumed for different uses in other sectors and more than 40% of total supplied biomass produces heat and electricity.

This process, when coupled with deep convection, could be an important part of the short-term atmospheric dynamics of water escape. However, the potential of this process to alter the horizontal distribution of moist air has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we conducted pre-research on the horizontal transport of water vapor associated with the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) at 50 Pa in the upper troposphere during major dust storms based on the Mars Climate Database (MCD) 5.3, a state-of-the-art database for Martian atmospheric research that has been validated as simulating the relevant short-period atmospheric dynamics well. We found westward-propagating diurnal patterns in the global water vapor front during nearly all the major dust storms from Martian years (MYs) 24 to 32. Statistical and correlation analyses showed that the diurnal transport of water vapor during global and A-season regional dust storms is dominated by the DW1. The effect of the tidal transport of water vapor varies with the types of dust storms in different seasons. During regional dust storms, the tidal transport induces only limited diurnal motion of the water vapor. However, the horizontal tidal wind tends to increase the abundance of daytime water vapor at mid- to low latitudes during the MY 28 southern summer global dust storm while decreasing it during the MY 25 southern spring global dust storm. The tidal transport process during these two global dust storms can induce opposite effects on water escape.","[Li, Jing; Wu, ZhaoPeng; Cui, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Planetary Environm & Astrobiol Res Lab, Zhuhai 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing; Li, Tao] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Key Lab Geospace Environm, Chinese Acad Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xi] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Wu, ZhaoPeng; Cui, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Lunar & Deep Space Explorat, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Wu, ZhaoPeng; Li, Tao; Cui, Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China","Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Astronomical Observatory, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Wu, ZP (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Planetary Environm & Astrobiol Res Lab, Zhuhai 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Wu, ZP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Lunar & Deep Space Explorat, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.;Wu, ZP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China.",wuzhp9@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Wu, Zhaopeng/0000-0001-5736-6482","Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB41000000]; China National Space Administration [D020105]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41525015, 41774186, 41674149, 41974175]; National Science Foundation [AST1740921]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515110815]; Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Lunar and Deep Space Exploration [LDSE201803]",Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China National Space Administration; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Lunar and Deep Space Exploration,"This work is supported by the B-type Strategic Priority Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant XDB41000000) and the pre-research project on Civil Aerospace Technologies of the China National Space Administration (grant D020105).

These emissions are assumed to increase by 150-250% in 2050 in business-as-usual scenarios with a tripling of world trade, while achieving a 1.52 C climate target requires net zero GHG emissions across all economic sectors. Consequentially, the maritime sector is facing the challenge to significantly reduce its GHG emissions as contribution to the international ambition to limit the effects of climate change. This article presents the results of a review of around 150 studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of the CO2 emissions reduction potentials and measures published in literature. It aims to identify the most promising areas, i.e. technologies and operational practices, and quantify the combined mitigation potential. Results show a significant variation in reported CO2 reduction potentials across reviewed studies. In addition, no single measure is sufficient to achieve meaningful GHG reductions. Emissions can be reduced by more than 75%, based on current technologies and by 2050, through a combination of measures if policies and regulations are focused on achieving these reductions. In terms of emissions per freight unit transported, it is possible to reduce emissions by a factor of 4-6. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Nineteen experts and 21 nonexperts made aesthetic evaluations of 100 figurative paintings. Participants then told personal stories associated with 10 paintings they evaluated as the most and least appealing. First, we found that some formal elements of paintings, for example their luminance, saturation, and complexity, interact with temperament traits predicting aesthetic appreciation. Second, expertise was a moderator of the relationship between formal elements of painting and aesthetic evaluation. Third, the more congruence between the emotional climate of a painting and the individual pattern of ideal emotional experience, the more appealing participants rated a painting. This last relationship was mediated by congruence between the emotional climate of a personal story associated with a painting and the individual pattern of ideal emotional experience.

However, little is known about the effects of abrupt climate change and climate catastrophes on them. The probability of occurrence of such events is largely unknown but the associated risks could be large enough to influence global climate policy. Amphibians are indicators of ecosystems' health and particularly sensitive to novel climate conditions. Using state-of-the-art climate model simulations, we present a global assessment of the effects of unabated global warming and a collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on the distribution of 2509 amphibian species across six biogeographical realms and extinction risk categories. Global warming impacts are severe and strongly enhanced by additional and substantial AMOC weakening, showing tipping point behavior for many amphibian species. Further declines in climatically suitable areas are projected across multiple clades, and biogeographical regions. Species loss in regional assemblages is extensive across regions, with Neotropical, Nearctic and Palearctic regions being most affected. Results underline the need to expand existing knowledge about the consequences of climate catastrophes on human and natural systems to properly assess the risks of unabated warming and the benefits of active mitigation strategies. Julian Velasco et al. use climate model simulations to show how the collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and unabated global warming under the RCP 8.5 scenario affect the global distribution of 2509 amphibian species. These results show severe and synergistic impacts of global warming, with particularly strong effects shown in the Neotropical, Nearctic and Palearctic regions.","[Velasco, Julian A.; Estrada, Francisco; Calderon-Bustamante, Oscar; Ureta, Carolina; Gay, Carlos] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Cdmx, Mexico; [Estrada, Francisco] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Estrada, Francisco] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Programa Invest Cambio Climat, Cdmx, Mexico; [Swingedouw, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Environm & Paleoenvironm Ocean & Continentaux, Pessac, France; [Ureta, Carolina] Catedra Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Tecnol, Cdmx, Mexico; [Defrance, Dimitri] Univ Montpellier, Univ Guyane, Univ Reunion, Univ Antilles,IRD,ESPACE DEV,Maison Teledetect, Montpellier, France; [Defrance, Dimitri] Climate Data Factory, Paris, France",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of La Reunion,"Estrada, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Cdmx, Mexico.;Estrada, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Estrada, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Programa Invest Cambio Climat, Cdmx, Mexico.",feporrua@atmosfera.unam.mx,"Swingedouw, Didier/M-5471-2019; Defrance, Dimitri/G-9988-2019","Swingedouw, Didier/0000-0002-0583-0850; Estrada Porrua, Francisco/0000-0002-1403-2180; Ureta, Carolina/0000-0003-3010-6407; Calderon-Bustamante, Oscar/0000-0002-0715-6871; Defrance, Dimitri/0000-0003-1371-294X",DGAPA/PAPIIT [IA201320]; French Atomic Commission (CEA) - Departement des sciences de la matieres; DSM-Energie Program,DGAPA/PAPIIT(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)); French Atomic Commission (CEA) - Departement des sciences de la matieres; DSM-Energie Program,"J.A.V. acknowledges financial support from DGAPA/PAPIIT under grant number IA201320.

Using the hindcast climatologies over the years 1991 to 2000, we looked specifically at the sea surface and soil level temperature over the tropics with respect to the hindcast start date. Our results indicate that the monthly evolution of large mean deviations from the observations (> +/-1 degrees C after 6 months) can be decomposed into two terms. One is the first month error, which results from the errors in the initial conditions plus the error introduced by the first month of coupling. It corresponds to the slowly varying component of the error, comparable to an initial shift that persists during the entire coupled experiment. The other term is the remaining time-evolving error, which is fast varying. We show that whereas the slowly varying term is strongly dependent upon the ocean and atmosphere component chosen for the coupling, the atmosphere generally controls the rapidly varying term to first order. The partition appears to be more balanced over some fractions of the Pacific warm pool and the east-equatorial coastal upwelling at certain seasons. These results, specific to seasonal forecasting and probably model dependent, can hardly be interpreted in terms of coupling mechanisms. The weak sensitivity of the mean error to the ocean component could in particular be related to the current limitations of state-of-the-art climate models.","Univ Paris 06, IRD, LOCEAN, CNRS,UMR 7617, F-75252 Paris, France; NOAA, NCEP, EMC, Camp Springs, MD 20746 USA; European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; CERFACS, F-31057 Toulouse, France; LSCE, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); CERFACS; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Lazar, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, IRD, LOCEAN, CNRS,UMR 7617, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris, France.",ala@lodyc.jussieu.fr,"Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J./C-1228-2016; Vintzileos, Augustin/ABD-4451-2021; lazar, alban/B-7290-2013","Doblas-Reyes, Francisco J./0000-0002-6622-4280; ",,,,,22,9,9,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1600-0870,,,TELLUS A,Tellus Ser.

Predictive skill derives from ocean initialization, which can capture variability internal to the climate system, and from external radiative forcing. Herein, we show that predictive skill for the NAO in a very large uninitialized multi-model ensemble is commensurate with previously reported skill from a state-of-the-art initialized prediction system. The uninitialized ensemble and initialized prediction system produce similar levels of skill for northern European precipitation and North Atlantic SSTs. Identifying these predictable components becomes possible in a very large ensemble, confirming the erroneously low signal-to-noise ratio previously identified in both initialized and uninitialized climate models. Though the results here imply that external radiative forcing is a major source of predictive skill for the NAO, they also indicate that ocean initialization may be important for particular NAO events (the mid-1990s strong positive NAO), and, as previously suggested, in certain ocean regions such as the subpolar North Atlantic ocean. Overall, we suggest that improving climate models' response to external radiative forcing may help resolve the known signal-to-noise error in climate models.","[Klavans, Jeremy M.; Clement, Amy C.; Murphy, Lisa N.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Cane, Mark A.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA",University of Miami; Columbia University,"Klavans, JM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",jeremy.klavans@colorado.edu,"; Murphy, Lisa/B-8547-2013","Klavans, Jeremy/0000-0002-6156-8981; Murphy, Lisa/0000-0003-4343-8005; Cane, Mark/0000-0001-5408-2388","NSF [AGS 1735245, AGS 1650209, AGS 1703076]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors are grateful for the helpful comments on this paper from Benjamin Kirtman, Yochanan Kushnir, and Doug Smith.

In this work we show that shallow-neural-network-based emulators of radiative transfer parameterizations developed almost a decade ago for a state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM) are robust with respect to the substantial structural and parametric change in the host model: when used in two 7-month-long experiments with a new GCM, they remain stable and generate realistic output.

By using Phase Change Materials (PCM) in the battery, the amount of latent heat that can be stored in the battery is increased in order to increase the thermal stability of the battery.

For the past period 1850-2006, atmospheric, hydrological and nutrient forcings were reconstructed, based on historical measurements. For the future period 1961-2098, scenario simulations were driven by regionalized global general circulation model (GCM) data and forced by various future greenhouse gas emission and air-and riverborne nutrient load scenarios (ranging from a pessimistic 'business-as-usual' to the most optimistic case). To estimate uncertainties, different models for the various parts of the Earth system were applied. Assuming the IPCC greenhouse gas emission scenarios A1B or A2, we found that water temperatures at the end of this century may be higher and salinities and oxygen concentrations may be lower than ever measured since 1850. There is also a tendency of increased eutrophication in the future, depending on the nutrient load scenario. Although cod biomass is mainly controlled by fishing mortality, climate change together with eutrophication may result in a biomass decline during the latter part of this century, even when combined with lower fishing pressure. Despite considerable shortcomings of state-of-the-art models, this study suggests that the future Baltic Sea ecosystem may unprecedentedly change compared to the past 150 yr. As stakeholders today pay only little attention to adaptation and mitigation strategies, more information is needed to raise public awareness of the possible impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.","[Meier, H.

Previous studies identified only a limited number of midlatitude regions where this reemergence occurs. Here we find that most of the global oceans exhibit winter-to-winter recurrence of SSTA. Indeed, recurrence of SSTA is the default process in the global ocean. Only regions strongly linked to El Nino do not show signs of SST reemergence. In midlatitudes, the temperature anomalies that recur persist below the shallow mixed layer in summer. However, SST recurrence is also found at some tropical locations and appears to be independent of subsurface ocean heat storage. Reemergence at these locations is linked to the recurrence of atmospheric drivers of SSTA, predominantly the wind-stress forcing. Our results are supported by different ocean data sets and by state-of-the-art climate model simulations. Plain Language Summary The study addresses the global distribution of the reemergence of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The reemergence of SST is the phenomenon that SST anomalies from one winter to the next reemerge, while they apparently disappear in the summer. This is linked to the SST anomalies being stored in the subsurface ocean. Recent studies have shown the role of reemergence on European weather, North Atlantic Oscillations, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In this study we show the regions where this phenomenon is strong in the global ocean and different mechanism that cause the recurrence. Here we find that the recurrence of SST anomalies is also apparent in the tropics, which is linked to the recurrence of wind-stress forcing at the location.","[Byju, P.; Dommenget, D.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Alexander, M.

For this purpose, we construct an ensemble of eight aquaplanet simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In each WRF-derived simulation, we replace only one parameterization at a time while all other parameters remain identical. By doing so, we aim to (i) reproduce cloud feedback uncertainty from state-of-the-art climate models and (ii) understand how parametrizations impact cloud feedbacks. Our results demonstrate that this ensemble of WRF simulations, which differ only in physical parameterizations, replicates the range of cloud feedback uncertainty found in state-of-the-art climate models. We show that microphysics and convective parameterizations govern the magnitude and sign of cloud feedbacks, mostly due to tropical low-level clouds in subsidence regimes. Finally, this study highlights the advantages of using WRF to analyze cloud feedback mechanisms owing to its plug-and-play parameterization capability.","[Cesana, Gregory] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cesana, Gregory] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Cesana, Gregory; Suselj, Kay] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Brient, Florent] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Toulouse, France",Columbia University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Cesana, G (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Cesana, G (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.;Cesana, G (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",gregory.cesana@columbia.edu,"Suselj, Kay/V-2962-2017","Suselj, Kay/0000-0002-8419-2198; Brient, Florent/0000-0001-8485-4705; Cesana, Gregory/0000-0002-8899-0509","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ROSES; Earth Science Program; Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; CloudSat-CALIPSO RTOP at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies; National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ROSES; Earth Science Program; Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; CloudSat-CALIPSO RTOP at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies; National Aeronautics and Space Administration at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology","G.

Given the anticipated increase in compound flood hazards in river deltas in a warming climate, climate-informed regional to local extreme water levels (EWLs) is thus critical for decision-makers to evaluate flood hazards and take adaptation measures. We develop a simple yet computationally efficient stress test framework, which combines historical and projected climatological information and a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model, to assess future compound coastal-fluvial flood hazards in river deltas. Our framework is applied in the world's largest single urban area, China's Pearl River Delta (PRD), which is also characterized by densely crossed river network. We find that extreme sea level is the dominant driver causing the compound coastal-fluvial flood in the PRD over the past 60 years. Meanwhile, there is large spatial heterogeneity of the individual and compound effects of the typhoon intensity, local sea-level rise, and riverine inflow on coastal-fluvial floods. In a plausible disruptive scenario (e.g., a 0.50 m sea-level rise combined with a 9% increase in typhoon intensity in a 2 degrees C warming), the EWL will increase by 0.76 m on average. An additional 1.54 and 0.56 m increase in EWL will occur in the river network and near the river mouth, respectively, if coastal floods coincide with the upstream mean annual flood. Findings from our modeling framework provide important insights to guide adaptation planning in river deltas to withstand future compound floods under climate change.","[Qiu, Jiangchao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jiangchao; He, Xiaogang] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Liu, Bingjun; Wang, Xiaola] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bingjun; Wang, Xiaola] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Engn Technol Res Ctr Water Secur Regula, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fang] Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Pearl River Estuary Regulat & Protect, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; National University of Singapore; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University,"He, XG (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore.;Liu, BJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Liu, BJ (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Engn Technol Res Ctr Water Secur Regula, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",liubj@mail.sysu.edu.cn; hexg@nus.edu.sg,"He, Xiaogang/R-7189-2017","He, Xiaogang/0000-0001-7428-0269","China-Scholarship-Council (China Scholarship Council) - National University of Singapore Joint PhD Scholarships Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52179029, 51879289]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019B1515120052]; Innovation Fund of Guangzhou City water science and technology [GZSWKJ-2020-2]; Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund Tier-1 project [R-302-000-265-133]; Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk [R-302-000-277-133]",China-Scholarship-Council (China Scholarship Council) - National University of Singapore Joint PhD Scholarships Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Innovation Fund of Guangzhou City water science and technology; Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund Tier-1 project; Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk,"J.

It is still a challenge to simulate the GS in terms of vegetative extent and precipitation using current climate models. This study attempts to simulate the Green Sahara 8000 years ago by using the state-of-the-art Earth system model CESM that incorporates the nitrogen cycle and the soil-precipitation feedbacks. Our study puts more emphasis on the impact of soil biophysical properties (e.g., bare-soil albedo, porosity, heat capacity, and hydraulic conductivity) and soil nitrogen influenced by soil organic matter on the simulation of the GS. In this coupled simulation, vegetation interacts with changes in soil properties and soil organic matter by phenology, decomposition, and allocation of carbon and nitrogen. With changes in the Earth's orbit and dust in the early to mid-Holocene, the model simulates increased precipitation in North Africa but does not capture the extent of the GS. Our analysis shows that the Holocene greening is simulated better if the amount of soil nitrogen and soil texture is properly modified for the humid and vegetative GS period. Soil biochemical and physical properties increase precipitation and vegetation cover in North Africa through their influence on photosynthesis and surface albedo as well as their consequent enhanced albedo-precipitation and evapotranspiration-precipitation feedbacks. Our findings suggest that future climate simulation needs to consider consequent changes in soil nitrogen and texture with changes in vegetation cover and density for proper climate simulations.","[Lee, Jooyeop; Kim, Jeongwon; Hong, Jinkyu] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ecosyst Atmosphere Proc Lab, Seoul, South Korea; [Claussen, Martin] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Claussen, Martin] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Hamburg, Germany; [Hong, Je-Woo] Korea Environm Inst, Korea Adaptat Ctr Climate Change, Sejong, South Korea; [Song, In-Sun] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Math Atmospher Phys Lab, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg; Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Yonsei University,"Hong, J (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ecosyst Atmosphere Proc Lab, Seoul, South Korea.",jhong@yonsei.ac.kr,,"Song, In-Sun/0000-0001-7211-6035; Kim, Jeongwon/0000-0002-3099-3563; Claussen, Martin/0000-0001-6225-5488",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF2018R1A5A1024958],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research has been supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (grant no.

While all state-of-the-art climate models consistently reproduce the sign of these changes, they largely disagree on their magnitude(1-4), the reasons for which remain contentious(3,5-7) . As such, consensual methods to reduce uncertainty in projections are lacking(7). Here, using the CMIP5 ensemble, we propose a process-oriented approach to revisit this issue. We show that intermodel differences in sea-ice loss and, more generally, in simulated sea-ice variability, can be traced to differences in the simulation of seasonal growth and melt. The way these processes are simulated is relatively independent of the complexity of the sea-ice model used, but rather a strong function of the background thickness. The larger role played by thermodynamic processes as sea ice thins(8,9) further suggests that the recent(10) and projected(11) reductions in seaice thickness induce a transition of the Arctic towards a state with enhanced volume seasonality but reduced interannual volume variability and persistence, before summer ice-free conditions eventually occur. These results prompt modelling groups to focus their priorities on the reduction of sea-ice thickness biases.","[Massonnet, Francois; Goosse, Hugues; Docquier, David; Fichefet, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Massonnet, Francois] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Dept Earth Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Vancoppenolle, Martin] UPMC Paris 6, Sorbonne Univ, LOCEAN IPSL, CNRS IRD MNHN, Paris, France; [Blanchard-Wrigglesworth, Edward] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC-CNS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Massonnet, F (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res TECLIM, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Massonnet, F (corresponding author), Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Dept Earth Sci, Barcelona, Spain.",francois.massonnet@uclouvain.be,"Vancoppenolle, Martin/AAA-7711-2022; Vancoppenolle, Martin/B-3750-2011; Docquier, David/P-5635-2019; Massonnet, Francois/J-5315-2014","Vancoppenolle, Martin/0000-0002-7573-8582; Docquier, David/0000-0002-5720-4253; Massonnet, Francois/0000-0002-4697-5781",Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS); European Commission's Horizon 2020 project APPLICATE [727862]; European Commission's Horizon 2020 project PRIMAVERA [641727],Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); European Commission's Horizon 2020 project APPLICATE; European Commission's Horizon 2020 project PRIMAVERA,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS), and the European Commission's Horizon 2020 projects APPLICATE (GA 727862) and PRIMAVERA (GA 641727).

Over the past few decades, anthropogenic aerosol emissions have exhibited remarkable changes in the magnitude and in spatial pattern. The most significant changes are the increased emissions over both South Asia and East Asia. In this study, the atmospheric component of a state-of-the-art climate model that includes eight species of tropospheric aerosols, coupled to a multi-level mixed-layer ocean model, has been used to investigate the impacts of Asian anthropogenic aerosol precursor emission changes from 1970s to 2000s on large scale circulation and precipitation in boreal summer over East Asia. Results reveal significant changes in circulation and clouds over East Asia and over the tropical and western North Pacific (WNP). Increased Asian AA emissions lead to anomalous cyclonic circulation over the Maritime continent (MC) and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the WNP, resulting in anomalous moisture transport convergence over the MC and therefore increased precipitation. They also lead to anomalous moisture flux divergence over both the WNP and large land areas of East Asia, especially over northern China, and therefore decreased precipitation there. These large scale circulation anomalies over the adjacent oceans are related to aerosol change induced ocean feedbacks, predominantly through ACI. It is the slow responses over the adjacent oceans (e.g., SST changes) through coupled atmosphere-ocean interaction in pre-monsoon seasons and summer that shape the changes of the East Asian summer monsoon and local precipitation. The results in this study suggest that increased Asian AA emissions from 1970s to 2000s may have played an important role for the observed southward shift of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone and precipitation belt, weakening of East Asian summer monsoon and reduced precipitation over northern China in East Asia during the latter half of the twentieth century.","[Dong, Buwen; Wilcox, Laura J.; Sutton, Rowan T.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Highwood, Eleanor J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Dong, BW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",b.dong@reading.ac.uk,"Wilcox, Laura J/F-3394-2013","Wilcox, Laura J/0000-0001-5691-1493; Dong, Buwen/0000-0003-0809-7911; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583","UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund; U.

In this paper, we explore how water-level fluctuations affect the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms, and based on the observations from case studies, we discuss the options and pitfalls to use water-level fluctuations for lake and reservoir management. A drawdown in summer causes an increase in retention time and increased water column nutrient concentrations and temperature of shallow water layers, which may lead to severe cyanobacterial blooms. This effect can potentially be counteracted by the positive response of submerged macrophytes, which compete for nutrients with cyanobacteria, with a higher chance of cyanobacterial blooms under eutrophic conditions. The balance between dominance by submerged macrophytes or cyanobacteria is temperature sensitive with stronger positive effects of drawdown as inhibition of cyanobacterial blooms expected in colder climates. Complete drying out reduces the amount of cyanobacteria in the water column after refilling, with lower water nutrient concentrations, lower fish biomass, lower abundance of cyanobacteria, higher transparency, and higher cover of submerged plants compared to lakes and reservoirs that did not dry out. Water-level rise as response to flooding has contrasting effects on the abundance of cyanobacteria depending on water quality. We conclude that water-level fluctuation management has potential to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms.

The objective was to investigate their indoor environmental quality in terms of public use. Objective environmental indicators like thermal environment, acoustic environment, light environment, and indoor air quality and 324 exercisers' valid responses to a subjective survey questionnaire were examined. The results found that air temperature and relative humidity in the sports buildings was high, with the average value of 31.6 degrees C and 68.5%, respectively. The exercisers found the thermal environment to be the least dissatisfying, with dissatisfaction rates of 22.6%, 21.9%, and 11.9% for temperature, air velocity, and relative humidity, respectively. Additionally, multiple linear regression indicated that thermal environment and the corresponding satisfaction were critical requirements affecting the indoor environmental quality. Moreover, the survey results of objective and subjective indicators were not simple linear correspondences but were affected by the interaction of indicators. Furthermore, the satisfaction values and range of objective indicators based on subjective satisfaction deviated from the relevant standards, primarily due to physical activities, sports building facade types, and regional climate. This study enhances knowledge about post occupancy evaluation of indoor environmental quality in naturally ventilated sports buildings. It could offer potent guidance to improve control and regulation of indoor environmental quality, thus contributing toward exercisers' satisfaction and comfort.","[Huang, Xiaodan; Zhao, Cheng; Peng, Yixuan] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Guangzhou 510090, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guang] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Guangzhou 510090, Peoples R China; [Guo, Wenzhi] South China Univ Technol Corp Ltd, Architectural Design & Res Inst, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Technology; Guangdong University of Technology,"Huang, XD (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Art & Design, Guangzhou 510090, Peoples R China.",dandyhuang@gdut.edu.cn,,,Guangdong (China) Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project;  [GD21YYS03],Guangdong (China) Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project; ,This work is supported by the Guangdong (China) Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (No. GD21YYS03) .

It is essential to expose and assess potential hazards facing cities, as well as to consider potential impacts and responses. While the promotion of efficiency and promise of protection have been common approaches to hazards in the past, recent events have exposed weaknesses in existing tactics. It has also become more apparent that existing mitigation efforts will be insufficient to prevent some level of climate change, associated hazards, and impacts. Complete protection against all threats is not only impossible but potentially hazardous, as extreme or unanticipated events can exceed the capacity for defence, potentially resulting in catastrophic failures. From this realization of the fallibility of the existing paradigm, resilience has emerged as a useful concept for framing the response of cities to an expanding collection of potential threats. The aim of this article is to consider resilience as it applies to cities, their architecture and infrastructure systems, subsystems, and components, as well as their inhabitants. Resilience characteristics are identified and considered in order to inform the eventual development of a resilience framework with which to assess architecture and infrastructure resilience. This state of the art is instrumental to determine the conditions under which architecture and infrastructure resilience can be defined and measured, in order to guide the consideration of at tributes and determine suitable criteria to select and elaborate indicators to help guide future actions and investments.","[Kallaos, James] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Civil Engn, Trondheim, Norway; [Wyckmans, Annemie] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Mainguy, Gaell] Veolia Environm Inst IVE, Sci Editorial Policy, Paris, France",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Kallaos, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Architectural Design Hist & Technol, Civil Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",james.kallaos@ntnu.no; annemie.wyckmans@ntnu.no,,"Kallaos, James/0000-0002-9750-7929","European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (Project RAMSES - Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities) [308497]","European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (Project RAMSES - Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities)","The work referenced has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. 308497 (Project RAMSES - Reconciling Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development for Cities) www.ramses-cities.eu.",,82,6,6,1,1,"UNIV STUDI NAPOLI FEDERICO II, DIPT PIANIFICAZIONE & SCIENZA TERRITORIO",NAPLES,"PIAZZALE TECCHIO 80, NAPLES, 80125, ITALY",1970-9889,1970-9870,,TEMA,TeMA,APR,2014,1,,,,5,27,,10.6092/1970-9870/2290,http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/1970-9870/2290,,,23,Urban Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Urban Studies,V1Q2D,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000217135000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nagam also discusses singing our bones home (2013), which situates the viewer in a dome-like structure and juxtaposes the architectural dwellings of a wagon shed and a wigwam, a nomadic form that offered more mobility to inhabitants. Her most recent work, A place to hold loss (2022), deals directly with the transformation of land through urban development and suggests mobile forms of dwelling as a possible way to limit destruction of land. Through her practice, Nagam poses urgent questions that have the potential to think through the current climate crisis and Indigenous futurisms.","[Nagam, Julie] Univ Winnipeg, Indigenous Arts Collaborat & Digital Media, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Nagam, Julie] Univ Winnipeg, Aabijijiwan New Media Lab, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Winnipeg; University of Winnipeg,"Nagam, J (corresponding author), Univ Winnipeg, Indigenous Arts Collaborat & Digital Media, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.;Nagam, J (corresponding author), Univ Winnipeg, Aabijijiwan New Media Lab, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0315-0836,1920-941X,,CAN THEATRE REV,Can.

I evaluate the relative impact that the Divan and scholarship on it had upon the two works. I further ask whether the artists and their sponsors felt compelled to downplay more contentious themes found in that legacy, given the ideal of intercivilizational dialogue so prominent in the discourses of German-Iranian cultural diplomacy. The paper offsets this critical reading, however, by highlighting the quite sophisticated treatments of occidental-oriental relations achieved by both works within their respective media.","[Hodkinson, James] Univ Warwick, German, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Hodkinson, J (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, German, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",j.r.hodkinson@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3683,1749-6284,,PUBL ENGL GOETHE SOC,Publ.

An annual signal fit to the residual monthly heights, corrected for atmospheric pressure and barotropic ocean loading effects, should primarily represent surface displacements due to long-wavelength variations in water storage. A comparison of the annual height signal from GPS and GRACE over Europe indicates that at most sites, the annual signals do not agree in amplitude or phase. We find that unlike the annual signal predicted from GRACE, the annual signal in the GPS heights is not coherent over the region, displaying significant variability from site to site. Confidence in the GRACE data and the unlikely possibility of large-amplitude small-scale features in the load field not captured by the GRACE data leads us to conclude that some of the discrepancy between the GPS and GRACE observations is due to technique errors in the GPS data processing. This is evidenced by the fact that the disagreement between GPS and GRACE is largest at coastal sites, where mismodeling of the semidiurnal ocean tidal loading signal can result in spurious annual signals.","Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Commun, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Luxembourg; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Newcastle University - UK,"van Dam, T (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Commun, 162A Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",tonie.vandam@uni.lu; wahr@longo.colorado.edu; d.a.lavallee@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,184,184,1,20,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9313,2169-9356,,J GEOPHYS RES-SOL EA,J.

State-of-the-art ensemble reconstructions reveal multi-decadal rainfall variability in the summer and winter rainfall zones. A decrease in precipitation amount over time is identified in the summer rainfall zone. No significant change in precipitation amount occurred in the winter rainfall zone, but rainfall variability has increased over time. Generally synchronous rainfall fluctuations between the two zones are identified on decadal scales, with common wet (dry) periods reconstructed around 1890 (1930). A strong relationship between seasonal rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the surrounding oceans is confirmed. Coherence among decadal-scale fluctuations of southern African rainfall, regional SST, SSTs in the Pacific Ocean and rainfall in south-eastern Australia suggest SST-rainfall teleconnections across the southern hemisphere. Temporal breakdowns of the SST-rainfall relationship in the southern African regions and the connection between the two rainfall zones are observed, for example during the 1950s. Our results confirm the complex interplay between large-scale teleconnections, regional SSTs and local effects in modulating multi-decadal southern African rainfall variability over long timescales.","[Neukom, Raphael] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Neukom, Raphael] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Nash, David J.] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England; [Nash, David J.; Grab, Stefan W.] Univ,Witwatersrand Wits, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Endfield, Georgina H.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Grove, Craig A.] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Geol, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; [Kelso, Clare] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, ZA-2006 Auckland Pk, South Africa; [Vogel, Coleen H.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Zinke, Jens] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Sch Earth & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Zinke, Jens] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia","University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Brighton; University of Witwatersrand; University of Nottingham; Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ); University of Johannesburg; University of Pretoria; University of Western Australia; Australian Institute of Marine Science","Neukom, R (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",neukom@giub.unibe.ch,"Neukom, Raphael/J-7842-2017; Zinke, Jens/G-5026-2011","Neukom, Raphael/0000-0001-9392-0997; Zinke, Jens/0000-0002-0634-8281; Nash, David/0000-0002-7641-5857",AIMS/CSIRO/UWA collaborative post-doctoral Fellowship; University of Brighton,AIMS/CSIRO/UWA collaborative post-doctoral Fellowship; University of Brighton,RN and DN would like to thank the University of Brighton for funding to support this study.

Advanced control technologies, such as optimal control, provide a framework to simultaneously regulate the system performance and limit control energy. However, little has been done so far to exploit the full potential of controller design in reducing the energy consumption while maintaining desirable system performance.

Elite (n = 9) and nonelite (n = 9) martial artists were recorded using motion capture techniques and features of whole-body movement defined at the segment level were investigated by principal components analysis. For both groups of subjects, four movement components explained > 90% of the variability in the data. Given our interest in temporal patterning, the time series derived from scores for each of the principal components were subsequently subjected to recurrence quantification analysis, participant by participant. For the first movement component, statistically significant differences between groups were detected for the recurrence measure determinism (p < 0.05). For the third movement component, statistically significant differences were detected for the recurrence measures laminarity and maxline (p < 0.01). Hence use of a combination of principal components and recurrence techniques revealed quantitative differences between movements of the two subject groups, differences that may represent more skilled motor control in the elite group related to the functional importance of these apparently simple movement patterns.","[Straiotto, B.

The urge for efficient tools for characterising and predicting the behaviour of such systems is nowadays particularly pressing, especially under the effects of a changing climate, and requires a deeper understanding of the connections among different drivers and different scales. To this aim, the present paper reviews the results of a set of interdisciplinary and coordinated experiences carried out in the Adriatic Sea (north-eastern Mediterranean region), discussing state-of-the art methods for coastal dynamics assessment and monitoring, and suggests strategies towards a more efficient coastal management. Coupled with detailed geomorphological information, the methodologies currently available for evaluating the different components of relative sea level rise facilitate a first identification of the flooding hazard in coastal areas, providing a fundamental element for the prioritization and identification of the sustainability of possible interventions and policies. In addition, hydro- and morpho-dynamic models are achieving significant advances in terms of spatial resolution and physical insight, also in a climatological context, improving the description of the interactions between meteo-oceanographic processes at the regional scale to coastal dynamics at the local scale. We point out that a coordinated use of the described tools should be promptly promoted in the design of survey and monitoring activities as well as in the exploitation of already collected data. Moreover, expected benefits from this strategy include the production of services and infrastructures for coastal protection with a focus on short-term forecast and rapid response, enabling the implementation of an event-oriented sampling strategy.","[Bonaldo, D.; Ricchi, A.; Carniel, S.] Natl Res Council ISMAR CNR, Inst Marine Sci, Arsenale Tesa 104,Castello 2737-F, I-30122 Venice, Italy; [Antonioli, F.] ENEA Natl Agcy New Technol Energy & Environm, Rome, Italy; [Archetti, R.; Gaeta, M.

However, the photovoltaic (PV) industry is characterised by linear economy structures, energy-intensive production, downcycling and little sustainability. One starting point for sustainable technologies is offered by the circular economy with its circular design principles. One problematic aspect of the design of crystalline PV modules is the encapsulation. In particular, the encapsulation avoids high-value recycling or the remanufacturing of modules, which could close loops and extend the lifetime of the products. For this reason, this paper provides an overview of the current state of encapsulation methods regarding production, materials and recycling. In addition, the current state of sustainability research in the photovoltaic sector is presented using the VOSviewer tool. Furthermore, alternative encapsulation technologies are discussed and compared in terms of performance and sustainability. The current encapsulation method using ethylene vinyl acetate as the encapsulation material offers major disadvantages in terms of performance and recyclability. Alternatives are the thermoplastic material polyolefin and the alternative structure of the NICE technology. Overall, however, research should focus more on sustainability and recyclability. Alternative module structures will be a decisive factor in this context.","[Schnatmann, Anna Katharina; Schoden, Fabian; Schwenzfeier-Hellkamp, Eva] Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany",Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences,"Schnatmann, AK (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ Appl Sci, Inst Tech Energy Syst ITES, D-33619 Bielefeld, Germany.",anna_katharina.schnatmann@fh-bielefeld.de,"Schoden, Fabian/AAN-7282-2020","Schoden, Fabian/0000-0002-2481-7141","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [490988677]; Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences","The APC was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)-490988677 and Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.",,63,1,1,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2022,16,,,,,,9971,10.3390/su14169971,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14169971,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,4A6SI,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000845228100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adverse effects include development of chlorotic and necrotic patches on leaves, reductions in total leaf area, plant height, photosynthesis, and yield. However, little work has been carried out to incorporate these experimental results into a simulation model and to estimate the effects of UV-B radiation under field conditions with varied environments and management practices. This study incorporates experimental results of UV-B effects on cotton crop into a cotton simulation model, GOSSYM, which is being used widely in various applications. In this work, first modules were modified to incorporate the effects of UV-B radiation on canopy photosynthesis, leaf area expansion, and stem and branch elongation. Then, the modified model was used to test the validity of model assumptions and algorithms on independent experimental data sets. Finally, preliminary studies were performed to simulate the effects of UV-B radiation in the field conditions at Stoneville, Mississippi using 30-year (1964-1993) climate data. Simulation results agreed well with experimental measurements, proving the validation of the model. Our results suggest that cotton lint yield declined with increased UV-B radiation. The reductions were 20% when UV-13 irradiance was 12 kJ m(-2) under irrigated conditions. Similar reductions in yield were predicted at lower UV-13 radiation (I 1 0 m-2) under rain-fed conditions. The modified model will be useful to simulate the impacts of UV-13 radiation on cotton growth and yield under current and future climatic conditions and to suggest management options to mitigate the adverse effects.","Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, USDA UV B Monitoring & Res Program, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Wang, XL (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, USDA UV B Monitoring & Res Program, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022; Reddy, K.

Information about the geographical distribution of individual trees is essential for the proper management of these systems. RGB high-resolution aerial images have emerged as a cheap and efficient source of data, although detecting and mapping single trees in an urban environment is a challenging task. Thus, we propose the evaluation of novel methods for single tree crown detection, as most of these methods have not been investigated in remote sensing applications. A total of 21 methods were investigated, including anchor-based (one and two-stage) and anchor-free state-of-the-art deep-learning methods. We used two orthoimages divided into 220 non-overlapping patches of 512 x 512 pixels with a ground sample distance (GSD) of 10 cm. The orthoimages were manually annotated, and 3382 single tree crowns were identified as the ground-truth. Our findings show that the anchor-free detectors achieved the best average performance with an AP50 of 0.686. We observed that the two-stage anchor-based and anchor-free methods showed better performance for this task, emphasizing the FSAF, Double Heads, CARAFE, ATSS, and FoveaBox models. RetinaNet, which is currently commonly applied in remote sensing, did not show satisfactory performance, and Faster R-CNN had lower results than the best methods but with no statistically significant difference. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the performance of novel deep-learning methods in remote sensing applications and could be used as an indicator of the most suitable methods in such applications.","[Zamboni, Pedro; Junior, Jose Marcato; Goncalves, Wesley Nunes] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Silva, Jonathan de Andrade; Matsubara, Edson Takashi; Goncalves, Wesley Nunes] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Comp Sci, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Miyoshi, Gabriela Takahashi] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Dept Cartog, BR-19060900 Presidente Prudente, Brazil; [Nogueira, Keiller] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Comp Sci & Math Div, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Estadual Paulista; University of Stirling,"Zamboni, P (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",pedro.zamboni@ufms.br; jose.marcato@ufms.br; jonathan.andrade@ufms.br; gabriela.t.miyoshi@unesp.br; edsontm@facom.ufms.br; keiller.nogueira@stir.ac.uk; wesley.goncalves@ufms.br,"; Marcato Junior, Jose/H-4406-2017","Takahashi Miyoshi, Gabriela/0000-0002-8571-1383; Marcato Junior, Jose/0000-0002-9096-6866; Matsubara, Edson/0000-0002-4471-0886; Nogueira, Keiller/0000-0003-3308-6384","CNPq [p: 433783/2018-4, 303559/2019-5, 304052/2019-1]; CAPES Print [p: 88881.311850/2018-01]; Fundect [59/300.066/2015]",CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES Print(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundect(Fundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT MS)),"This research was partially funded by CNPq (p: 433783/2018-4, 303559/2019-5 and 304052/2019-1), CAPES Print (p: 88881.311850/2018-01) and Fundect (p: 59/300.066/2015).",,65,6,6,0,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JUL,2021,13,,,,,,2482,10.3390/rs13132482,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13132482,,,25,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,TG0UB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000671127300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model was applied over Europe for May 2008, during which the EUCAARI-LONGREX (European Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality Interactions-Long-Range Experiment) campaign was carried out, providing aircraft vertical profiles of aerosol number concentrations. The updated model reproduces the observed number concentrations of particles larger than 4 nm within 1 order of magnitude throughout the atmospheric column. This agreement is encouraging considering the fact that no semi-empirical fitting was needed to obtain realistic particle formation rates. The cloud adjustment scheme for modifying the photolysis rate profiles within PMCAMx-UF was also updated with the TUV (Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible) radiative-transfer model. Results show that, although the effect of the new cloud adjustment scheme on total number concentrations is small, enhanced new-particle formation is predicted near cloudy regions. This is due to the enhanced radiation above and in the vicinity of the clouds, which in turn leads to higher production of sulfuric acid.

Yet, the characteristics of urban space produce a fragmented sense of our water resources. Cape Town, South Africa, the context of this research, is one such city whose water challenges have been exacerbated by climate change-induced drought, to the extent that the city nearly shut off the water running to residents' taps. This context presents a particular challenge for the focus of this special issue, transformative and transgressive learning, an emerging arena of thought and practice concerned with learning processes that might foster more sustainable socio-ecological relations. The empirical material for this research draws from 12 arts-based inquiry workshops run with youth in an environmental organisation over four months, exploring a local water crisis. The data were generated through an engaged arts-based research process. The paper traces how transformative and transgressive learning in the context of urban water crisis might be characterised as making (non)sense by bringing the empirical material into dialogue with five entry points of transformative and transgressive learning literature rooted in Freirean educational praxis. This paper crafts and engages the concept of making (non)sense, a way of thinking about qualities and processes of learning praxis that responds to the wicked sustainability challenges we face today, particularly in terms of a Global South perspective. I argue such a praxis needs qualities and processes that disrupt and trouble the norm in the context of the socio-ecological challenge of urban water.","[James, Anna] Rhodes Univ, Environm Learning Res Ctr, ZA-6139 Makhanda, South Africa",Rhodes University,"James, A (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Environm Learning Res Ctr, ZA-6139 Makhanda, South Africa.",annakajam@gmail.com,,,National Research Foundstion SARChI Chair in Global Change and Social Learning Systems at Rhodes University,National Research Foundstion SARChI Chair in Global Change and Social Learning Systems at Rhodes University,Funding support for this research came from National Research Foundstion SARChI Chair in Global Change and Social Learning Systems at Rhodes University.,,42,1,1,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,23,,,,,,6817,10.3390/su11236817,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236817,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000508186400289,View Full Record in Web of Science

Uncertainty in convective parameterization is the leading cause of the widespread climate sensitivity in IPCC global warming projections. This paper reviews the observations and parameterizations of atmospheric convection with emphasis on the cloud structure, bulk effects, and closure assumption. The representative state-of-the-art convection schemes are presented, including the ECMWF convection scheme, the Grell scheme used in NCEP model and WRF model, the Zhang-MacFarlane scheme used in NCAR and DOE models, and parameterizations of shallow moist convection. The observed convection has self-suppression mechanisms caused by entrainment in convective updrafts, surface cold pool generated by unsaturated convective downdrafts, and warm and dry lower troposphere created by mesoscale downdrafts. The post-convection environment is often characterized by diamond sounding suggesting an over-stabilization rather than barely returning to neutral state. Then the pre-convection environment is characterized by slow moistening of lower troposphere triggered by surface moisture convergence and other mechanisms. The over-stabilization and slow moistening make the convection events episodic and decouple the middle/upper troposphere from the boundary layer, making the state-type quasi-equilibrium hypothesis invalid. Right now, unsaturated convective downdrafts and especially mesoscale downdrafts are missing in most convection schemes, while some schemes are using undiluted convective updrafts, all of which favour easily turned-on convection linked to double-ITCZ (inter-tropical convergence zone), overly weak MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) and precocious diurnal precipitation maximum. We propose a new strategy for convection scheme development using reanalysis-driven model experiments such as the assimilation runs in weather prediction centres and the decadal prediction runs in climate modelling centres, aided by satellite simulators evaluating key characteristics such as the lifecycle of convective cloud-top distribution and stratiform precipitation fraction.","[Lin, Jialin; Qian, Taotao] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bechtold, Peter] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecast, Shinfield, England; [Bechtold, Peter] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecast, Bologna, Italy; [Bechtold, Peter] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecast, Bonn, Germany; [Grell, Georg] NOAA Global Syst Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Zhang, Guang J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, CASPO, San Diego, CA 92093 USA; [Zhu, Ping] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Freitas, Saulo R.] Natl Inst Space Res, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Barnes, Hannah] NOAA CIRES Global Syst Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Han, Jongil] NOAA NCEP Environm Modeling Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Lin, JL (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lin.789@osu.edu,,,"NSF [AGS1822238, AGS-1347132, AGS-2054697]; NOAA [NA16NWS4680029, NA18NWS4680057]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Jialin Lin and Taotao Qian was supported by NSF [grant number AGS-1347132].

A variety of complementary, multiannual observational records have revealed Earth-like cycling of dust and water through the Mars system, as well as hints of dynamical coupling between the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere involving deep convection, planetary waves, thermal tides, and gravity waves that can be analogous to, but sometimes very different from, coupling processes in the Earth's atmosphere. This review focuses on several essential coupling processes on Mars involving the dust/water cycling and wave activity: (1) interaction between the dust cycle, water cycle and wave activity in the lower atmosphere; (2) the global meridional circulation and middle atmospheric polar warmings; and (3) vertical coupling throughout the atmosphere during dusty/non-dusty conditions. Most of these processes have been studied with state-of-the-art numerical models validated with recent observations. In addition, we summarize several newly proposed hypotheses that potentially impact our understanding of major issues in planetary science such as atmospheric coupling, water escape, or mesospheric cloud formation. We find many similarities between wave-induced couplings on Earth and Mars and analogies between the Earth's water cycle and Mars's dust cycle, which provide insights into comparative studies of these two planets.","[Wu, Zhaopeng; Li, Jing; Cui, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Planetary Environm & Astrobiol Res Lab, Zhuhai 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Tao; Yang, Chengyun] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, CAS Key Lab Geospace Environm, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Heavens, Nicholas G.] Imperial Coll, Dept Earth Sci & Engn, London, England; [Newman, Claire E.; Richardson, Mark, I] Aeolis Res, Chandler, AZ USA; [Wu, Zhaopeng; Li, Tao; Yang, Chengyun; Cui, Jun] CAS Ctr Excellence Comparat Planetol, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Heavens, Nicholas G.] Space Sci Inst, Boulder, CO 80301 USA","Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Imperial College London","Wu, ZP (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Planetary Environm & Astrobiol Res Lab, Zhuhai 519082, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wuzhp9@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Li, Tao/J-8950-2014","Li, Tao/0000-0002-5100-4429; Wu, Zhaopeng/0000-0001-5736-6482","B-type Strategic Priority Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB41000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42004147, 42004133, 41774186, 41974175]",B-type Strategic Priority Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors would like to acknowledge support from the B-type Strategic Priority Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant XDB41000000, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China through grants 42004147, 42004133, 41774186, and 41974175.",,243,7,7,7,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0012-8252,1872-6828,,EARTH-SCI REV,Earth-Sci.

It is native of Asia Minor, and it is cultivated in Mediterranean countries. Saffron predominantly contains certain chemical constituents that are responsible for imparting colour, flavour, and aroma. Some of its components have cytotoxic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor properties. Since, saffron is a triploid (2n = 3x = 24) plant and fails to produce seed upon selfing or crossing, so it is propagated through corms. The growing area for saffron is not extensive, although its demand in the international market is increasing. Research activities have been initiated to develop new production technologies of this spice in many countries. Saffron grows best in friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay calcareous soils. Besides, climate and soil, planting time, seed/corm rate, planting depth, corm size/weight, crop density, nutrient management, weed management, growth regulators, harvest, and post-harvest management also influence saffron quality and quantity. In this paper, an attempt has been made to compile the recent agronomic research on saffron for commercial flower and corm production.","[Kumar, Rakesh; Singh, Virendra; Devi, Kiran; Sharma, Madhu; Singh, M.

State-of-the-art homogenisation approaches use various flavours of pairwise comparison between a target station and candidate neighbour station series. Such approaches require an adequate number of neighbours of sufficient quality and comparability - a condition that is met for most station series since the mid-20th Century. However, pairwise approaches have challenges where suitable neighbouring stations are sparse, as remains the case in vast regions of the globe and is common almost everywhere prior to the early 20th Century. Modern sparse-input centennial reanalysis products continue to improve and offer a potential alternative to pairwise comparison, particularly where and when observations are sparse. They do not directly ingest or use land-based surface temperature observations, so they are a formally independent estimate. This may be particularly helpful in cases where structurally similar changes exist across broad networks, which challenges current techniques in the absence of metadata. They also potentially offer a valuable methodologically distinct method, which would help explore structural uncertainty in homogenisation techniques. The present study compares the potential of spatially-interpolated sparse-input reanalysis products to neighbour-based approaches to perform homogenisation of global monthly land surface air temperature records back to 1850 based upon the statistical properties of station-minus-reanalysis and station-minus-neighbour series. This shows that neighbour-based approaches likely remain preferable in data dense regions and epochs. However, the most recent reanalysis product, NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20CRv3, is potentially preferable in cases where insufficient neighbours are available. This may in particular affect long-term global average estimates where a small number of long-term stations in data sparse regions will make substantial contributions to global estimates and may contain missed data artefacts in present homogenisation approaches.","[Gillespie, Ian M.; Thorne, Peter W.] Maynooth Univ, ICARUS Climate Res Ctr, Dept Geog, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Haimberger, Leo] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria; [Compo, Gilbert P.] Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Compo, Gilbert P.] NOAA, Phys Sci Lab, Boulder, CO USA",Maynooth University; University of Vienna; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Thorne, PW (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",peter@peter-thorne.net,"Thorne, Peter/F-2225-2014","Thorne, Peter/0000-0003-0485-9798",Climate Program Office; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory,Climate Program Office; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory,Climate Program Office; NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory,,51,5,5,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

One possible explanation for missing ratings is motivated by the spiral of silence theory. When the majority opinion is formed, a spiral process is triggered where users are more and more likely to show their ratings if they perceive that they are supported by the opinion climate. In this paper we first verify the existence of the spiral process in recommender systems by using a variety of different real-life datasets. We then study the characteristics of two key factors in the spiral process: opinion climate and the hardcore users who will give ratings even when they are minority opinion holders. Based on our empirical findings, we develop four variants to model missing ratings. They mimic different components of the spiral of silence based on the spiral process with global opinion climate, local opinion climate, hardcore users, relationships between hardcore users and items, respectively. We experimentally show that, the presented variants all outperform state-of-the-art recommendation models with missing rating components.","[Lin, Chen; Liu, Dugang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 361000, Peoples R China; [Tong, Hanghang] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Xiao, Yanghua] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Fudan University,"Lin, C (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 361000, Peoples R China.",chenlin@xmu.edu.cn; dgliu@stu.xmu.edu.cn; htong@illinois.edu; shawyh@fudan.edu.cn,"XIAO, YANG/GPW-5529-2022; Lin, Chen/GRR-2799-2022",,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0803700, 2017YFC1201200]; National NSFC [61472085, 61472335, 61972328]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology project [16511102102, 16JC1420401]; Shanghai STCSM's RD Program [16JC1420400]",National Key R&D Program of China; National NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology project; Shanghai STCSM's RD Program,"This paper was supported by National Key R&D Program of China under No.2017YFC0803700, No.2017YFC1201200, by the National NSFC (No.61472085, 61472335, 61972328), by Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology project (No.16511102102, No.16JC1420401), Shanghai STCSM's R&D Program under Grant (No.16JC1420400).",,53,0,0,12,15,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1041-4347,1558-2191,,IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN,IEEE Trans.

The ERATOSTHENES Research Centre (ERC) with the vision to become a Centre of Excellence for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment (EXCELSIOR H2020: Teaming project) already operates (within Phase 1) a fully established EARLINETt-Cloudnet supersite at Limassol, Cyprus, for a period of 2 years, in close collaboration with the German Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS), The scientific aspects of this prototype-like field campaign Cy-CARE (Cyprus Cloud Aerosol and Rain Experiment) - a common initiative between the Cyprus University of Technology (CUT), Limassol and TROPOS-are presented in this paper. Cy-CARE has been designed by TROPOS and CUT to fill a gap in the understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction in one of the key regions of climate change and how precipitation formation is influenced by varying aerosol/pollution and meteorological conditions The guiding questions are: How may rain patterns change in future and what may be the consequences of climate change in arid regions such as EMME. EXCELSIOR is a team effort between CUT (acting as the coordinator), the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics Space Applications and Remote Sensing of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), TROPOS and the Cyprus Department of Electronic Communications of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works (DEC-MTCW) who will work together to improve the network structures significantly, resulting in Cyprus being regarded as a cornerstone of a European Network of active remote sensing of the atmosphere.","[Mamouri, Rodanthi-Elisavet; Hadjimitsis, Diofantos G.; Nisantzi, Argyro; Michaelides, Silas; Themistocleous, Kyriacos] Cyprus Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, ERATOSTHENES Res Ctr, Dept Civil Engn & Technol Remote Sensing & Geoenv, 2-8 Saripolou, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus; [Ansmann, Albert; Buehl, Johannes; Seifert, Patric; Engelmann, Ronny; Wandinger, Ulla] Leibniz Inst Tropospharenforsch, Leipzig, Germany; [Kontoes, Charalampos] Natl Observ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Schreier, Gunter] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt eV DLR, Berlin, Germany; [Komodromos, Georgios] Minist Transport Communicat & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Nicosia, Cyprus",Cyprus University of Technology; Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); National Observatory of Athens; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Mamouri, RE (corresponding author), Cyprus Univ Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, ERATOSTHENES Res Ctr, Dept Civil Engn & Technol Remote Sensing & Geoenv, 2-8 Saripolou, CY-3036 Limassol, Cyprus.",rodanthi.mamouri@cut.ac.cy,"KONTOES, Charalampos/L-5514-2013; Wandinger, Ulla/E-3348-2014; Seifert, Patric/D-2448-2014; Nisantzi, Argyro/AAC-6012-2020; Mamouri, Rodanthi Elisavet/E-8666-2017; HADJIMITSIS, DIOFANTOS/H-8813-2013","Wandinger, Ulla/0000-0003-3676-9121; Seifert, Patric/0000-0002-5626-3761; Nisantzi, Argyro/0000-0001-8159-248X; Mamouri, Rodanthi Elisavet/0000-0003-4836-8560; Themistocleous, Kyriacos/0000-0003-4149-8282; Themistocleous, Kyriacos/0000-0002-1227-8240; Engelmann, Ronny/0000-0003-4225-9961; HADJIMITSIS, DIOFANTOS/0000-0002-2684-547X","EXCELSIOR (ERATOSTHENES: Excellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment) Teaming Project from the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [7633643, H2020-WIDESPREAD-04-2017]; European Union (H-INFRAIA) [654109]",EXCELSIOR (ERATOSTHENES: Excellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment) Teaming Project from the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme; European Union (H-INFRAIA),"The authors acknowledge funding by the EXCELSIOR (ERATOSTHENES: Excellence Research Centre for Earth Surveillance and Space-Based Monitoring of the Environment) Teaming Project which receives funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement No 7633643: Work programme H2020 under Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation, call: H2020-WIDESPREAD-04-2017: TeamingPhase1 (Coordination and Support Action) (www.excelsior2020.eu).

Nonetheless, overall trends and frontiers in this research area have not been characterized and are poorly understood. This study aims to assess the current status, evolution, and emerging topics in this area through a bibliometric and network analysis of 1134 extracted publications from 1983 to 2018. This systematic review shows that nearly half the studies on household energy consumption were published in just three journals (namely, Energy Policy; Energy; and Energy Economics) with a focus on three areas (Environmental Sciences and Ecology; Energy and Fuels; Business and Economics). The findings also show that among contributing countries, the USA and China have the closest ties and wield the most academic influence. Furthermore, emerging and pioneering studies on behavioral interventions, energy conservation, and energy poverty and those pertaining to climate and electricity consumption may constitute the research frontier.","[Han, Xiao; Wei, Chu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Appl Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Wei, C (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Appl Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",xiaochu1979@gmail.com,"Wei, Chu/AAB-4872-2021","Wei, Chu/0000-0002-7704-5544","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71622014, 41771564]; National Statistical Research Program [2019LD09]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Statistical Research Program,"We thank the support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71622014, 41771564) and the National Statistical Research Program (2019LD09).",,111,12,12,10,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

An incremental path forward is smoothed for patients who are not yet prepared to analyze, and builds eventually into something readily recognizable as an analysis. The term analytic preparation refers to this set of processes. Early on, the analyst is concerned less with facilitating an early replica of an idealized analysis than with facilitating the mutual adaptation of patient and analyst as they begin to negotiate a thought community. Since analytic preparation is not an entity, it does not neatly overlap in real time with the opening phase as usually described, does not have a discrete beginning or end, and does not abruptly shift midstream into analysis proper.

The negative consequences of moisture intrusion caused by WDR include degradation of surface material, frost damage, salt efflorescence, structural cracking, interior damage, etc. WDR has been extensively studied through experimental measurements, numerical simulations, and semi-empirical methods. The previous WDR studies can be categorized into two areas: the study of WDR loading on buildings and the investigation of facade response to the impinging raindrops. While previous studies have investigated the characteristics of WDR loading on facade, such as the wetting pattern on various building configurations, i.e. stand-alone (isolated), street canyon, building-array, urban area. This review paper synthesizes results from the previous studies and provides a comprehensive summary and comparison of research approaches and their outcomes regarding quantification of WDR loading on building facades. The effect of meteorological and geometrical parameters on the interaction of WDR and buildings has been discussed. A cross-comparison of the WDR results has been performed based on previous experimental, CFD, and semi-empirical studies. The effectiveness of RANS and LES approaches has also been discussed. This paper shows that WDR results depend on the CFD approach selected and on the type of WDR modeling techniques used, i.e. Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT), and Eulerian Multiphase (EM). It is important to consider turbulent dispersion for the lower part of the windward facade in the case of high-rise buildings in CFD simulations. Finally, the review highlights potential research gaps in WDR.","[Gholamalipour, Payam; Ge, Hua; Stathopoulos, Ted] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Ge, H (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",hua.ge@concordia.ca,,"Ge, Hua/0000-0003-1368-4301; Gholamalipour, Payam/0000-0002-7245-7267",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science of Concordia University,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science of Concordia University,"Financial support received from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through the Discovery grant program to the second and third author, as well as the support received from the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science of Concordia University are gratefully acknowledged.",,106,0,0,12,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

While the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration is due primarily to fossil fuel burning, natural climate variabilities are known to introduce intermittent changes in the global CO2 growth rates. Thus, understanding the correlation of climate and carbon cycling systems is important in assessing the anthropogenic and natural impacts. Here, we report decadal CO2 variabilities in western Pacific based on data from several ground-based stations in the region and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). In addition to the well-established El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), there exists a decadal changing CO2 trend in the datasets mentioned above. Analysis of ground-based CO2 measurements in northern Taiwan shows a decadal signal at amplitudes of -5 ppm. In contrast, AIRS shows a similar trend but at a reduced amplitude of -1 ppm. We attribute the decadal signal to dynamical factors related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

In Europe, this trend is in line with the political willingness to internalize externalities in transport pricing policies. This paper has two purposes. It first identifies the recent work achieved in the field of external costs of road and intermodal freight transport, where each paper is assessed in terms of its perspective (academic or project oriented), its objective (prescription, application, projection), the type of externality (air pollution, climate change, noise, accidents, congestion) and the type of cost (marginal, average, total) that is considered. The literature review reveals a gap in the development of generic mathematical functions for external costs of transport. The second objective of the paper is thus to highlight the usefulness of such functions by identifying the main parameters that influence freight transport competitiveness in terms of external costs, and by determining which of these parameters should be incorporated in further research works.","[Mostert, Martine; Limbourg, Sabine] Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, QuantOM, Rue Louvrex 14, B-4000 Liege, Belgium",University of Liege,"Mostert, M (corresponding author), Univ Liege, HEC Management Sch, QuantOM, Rue Louvrex 14, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",martine.mostert@ulg.ac.be,,,"FRS-FNRS (Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique); Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme; Belgian Science Policy Office, Comex [P7/36]","FRS-FNRS (Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Belgian Science Policy Office, Comex","Martine Mostert acknowledges the financial support of FRS-FNRS (Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique).

This coupled behaviour causes various land-atmosphere feedbacks, and an insufficient understanding of these feedbacks contributes to uncertain global climate model projections. For example, a crucial role of the land surface in exacerbating summer heat waves in midlatitude regions has been identified empirically for high-impact heat waves, but individual climate models differ widely in their respective representation of land-atmosphere coupling. Here, we compile an ensemble of 54 combinations of observations-based temperature (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) benchmarking datasets and investigate coincidences of T anomalies with ET anomalies as a proxy for land-atmosphere interactions during periods of anomalously warm temperatures. First, we demonstrate that a large fraction of state-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive produces systematically too frequent coincidences of high T anomalies with negative ET anomalies in midlatitude regions during the warm season and in several tropical regions year-round. These coincidences (high T, low ET) are closely related to the representation of temperature variability and extremes across the multi-model ensemble. Second, we derive a land-coupling constraint based on the spread of the T-ET datasets and consequently retain only a subset of CMIP5 models that produce a land-coupling behaviour that is compatible with these benchmark estimates. The constrained multi-model simulations exhibit more realistic temperature extremes of reduced magnitude in present climate in regions where models show substantial spread in T-ET coupling, i.e. biases in the model ensemble are consistently reduced. Also the multi-model simulations for the coming decades display decreased absolute temperature extremes in the constrained ensemble. On the other hand, the differences between projected and present-day climate extremes are affected to a lesser extent by the applied constraint, i.e. projected changes are reduced locally by around 0.5 to 1 degrees C-but this remains a local effect in regions that are highly sensitive to land-atmosphere coupling. In summary, our approach offers a physically consistent, diagnostic-based avenue to evaluate multi-model ensembles and subsequently reduce model biases in simulated and projected extreme temperatures.","[Sippel, Sebastian; Mahecha, Miguel D.; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Sippel, Sebastian; Zscheischler, Jakob; Orth, Rene; Vogel, Martha; Seneviratne, Sonia I.] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8075 Zurich, Switzerland",Max Planck Society; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Sippel, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.;Sippel, S (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8075 Zurich, Switzerland.",ssippel@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Mahecha, Miguel D/F-2443-2010; Orth, Rene/AAG-7034-2021; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011; Orth, Rene/AFK-1975-2022; Zscheischler, Jakob/ABE-7324-2021; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Orth, Rene/AAF-9279-2022","Mahecha, Miguel D/0000-0003-3031-613X; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Zscheischler, Jakob/0000-0001-6045-1629; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Sippel, Sebastian/0000-0002-4510-4458; Vogel, Martha Marie/0000-0001-9509-7332",National Science Foundation; European Commission [640176]; European Research Council (ERC) [617518]; German National Academic Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); German National Academic Foundation,"We are grateful to the creators, maintainers, and providers of all datasets.

The payload comprised an innovative combination of remote sensing and in situ instruments. The in situ instruments provided high-resolution observations of cirrus and polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), a large number of reactive and long-lived trace gases, and temperature at the aircraft level. Information above and underneath the aircraft level was achieved by remote sensing instruments as well as dropsondes. The mission took place from 8 December 2015 to 18 March 2016, covering the extremely cold late December to early February period and the time around the major warming in the beginning of March. In 18 scientific deployments, 156 flight hours were conducted, covering latitudes from 25 degrees to 87 degrees N and maximum altitudes of almost 15 km, and reaching potential temperature levels of up to 410 K. Highlights of results include 1) new aspects of transport and mixing in the Arctic upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS), 2) detailed analyses of special dynamical features such as tropopause folds, 3) observations of extended PSCs reaching sometimes down to HALO flight levels at 13-14 km, 4) observations of particulate NOy and vertical redistribution of gas-phase NOy in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS), 5) significant chlorine activation and deactivation in the LMS along with halogen source gas observations, and 6) the partitioning and budgets of reactive chlorine and bromine along with a detailed study of the efficiency of ClOx/BrOx ozone loss cycle. Finally, we quantify-based on our results-the ozone loss in the 2015/16 winter and address the question of how extraordinary this Arctic winter was.","[Oelhaf, Hermann; Sinnhuber, Bjorn-Martin; Woiwode, Wolfgang; Boenisch, Harald; Friedl-Vallon, Felix; Johansson, Sren; Kretschmer, Erik; Orphal, Johannes; Zahn, Andreas] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Bozem, Heiko; Hoor, Peter; Krause, Jens; Voigt, Christiane] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Atmospher Phys, Mainz, Germany; [Engel, Andreas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Atmospher & Environm Sci, Frankfurt, Germany; [Fix, Andreas; Jurkat-Witschas, Tina; Kaufmann, Stefan; Marsing, Andreas; Rapp, Markus; Voigt, Christiane; Wirth, Martin; Ziereis, Helmut] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Atmospher Phys, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Grooss, Jens-Uwe; Kraemer, Martina; Preusse, Peter; Riese, Martin; Rolf, Christian; Ungermann, Jrn] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK7, Julich, Germany; [Lorks, Dominique; Pfeilsticker, Klaus] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, Heidelberg, Germany; [Pitts, Michael] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23665 USA; [Poole, Lamont] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA USA; [Volk, C.

This paper provides a review of the current state of EE research by mapping the research landscape in business and economics to understand the socioeconomic dimensions within these research areas. To identify key information, we examine the trends and characteristics of 2935 relevant scientific publications over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2019 in the Social Science Citation Index of the Web of Science database using bibliometric analysis with a R language package called 'bibliometrix'. Our analysis shows an increasing trend in publications from 2006 onwards; the period remarkably coincides with the implementation phase of the Kyoto protocol in 2005. Accordingly, we observe that EE research has a strong association with issues like CO2 emissions, climate change, sustainability, and the growing importance of these issues in recent years. Thus, our findings provide crucial understandings by incorporating a wide array of scientific outputs in response to calls for greater theoretical clarification of EE research. These findings provide insights into the current state of the art of, and identify crucial areas for future, research. Hence, our research assists in formulating environmentally sustainable policies to tackle the adverse effects of CO2 emissions and related climate change through providing critical grasps on the scholarly development related to EE.","[Mahi, Masnun; Ismail, Izlin] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Phoong, Seuk Wai] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Operat & Management Informat Syst, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Isa, Che Ruhana] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Ismail, I (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",masnunmahi@um.edu.my; izlin@um.edu.my; phoongsw@um.edu.my; cruhana@um.edu.my,"Ismail, Izlin/B-8678-2010; Phoong, Seuk Wai/AAA-6634-2019; Mahi, Masnun Al/AAI-6121-2020; ISA, C.R./B-8360-2010; Phoong, Seuk Wai/L-9964-2016","Ismail, Izlin/0000-0003-4805-4502; Phoong, Seuk Wai/0000-0002-9925-0901; Mahi, Masnun Al/0000-0001-9137-4822; Phoong, Seuk Wai/0000-0002-9925-0901; Isa, Che Ruhana/0000-0001-7253-8123","Long-Term Research Grant Scheme by the Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia); University of Malaya, Malaysia [LR001B-2016A]","Long-Term Research Grant Scheme by the Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia); University of Malaya, Malaysia(Universiti Malaya)","This research was funded by the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme by the Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia) and the University of Malaya, Malaysia, grant number LR001B-2016A.",,74,7,7,9,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The format is a case study for January through March 1989 (JFM89) and the primary emphasis is on regional scales over North America. The SST boundary conditions in the AGCM simulations were prescribed using observed weekly data. Experiments were made in which the week-to-week (subseasonal) SST variability was suppressed. In terms of the largest spatial scales, the subseasonal SST variability has only a modest impact; however, statistically significant modifications to the 500-mb height anomalies over North America were detected. Consistent with these changes in the height field, the seasonal mean North American rainfall anomalies were particularly sensitive to the subseasonal SST variations, especially over the Pacific Northwest. Two possible mechanisms for this sensitivity were investigated with additional AGCM experiments and model diagnostics. The first mechanism, referred to as a stochastic'' effect, is defined by the hypothesis that the week-to-week SST variability only serves to enhance the amplitude of tropical precipitation variability, which, in turn, modifies the midlatitude response. With this stochastic effect, the details of the subseasonal SST evolution do not matter. In contrast, the second mechanism is a deterministic'' effect in that the details of the evolution of the subseasonal SST matter. The experiments presented here indicate that the stochastic effect is small and that the details of the subseasonal SST produce significant differences. This conclusion is supported by experiments with very large ensembles using a somewhat lower-resolution AGCM and a nonlinear barotropic model. Finally, some implications of these results for real-time forecasting are discussed.","Inst Global Environm & Soc Inc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA",,"Kirtman, BP (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm & Soc Inc, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",kirtman@cola.iges.org,"Kinter, James/A-8610-2015","Kinter, James/0000-0002-6277-0559",,,,,29,21,21,0,3,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Postcombustion CO2 capture with chemical solvent is considered one of the most important technologies in order to reduce CO2 emission. Amino acid salt solutions have attracted special attention in recent years due to their excellent physicochemical properties, e.g., low volatility, less toxicity, and high oxidative stability, as well as capture performance comparable with conventional amines. In this study, physicochemical properties of 20 amino acids are reported and their CO2 absorption performance discussed. The topics covered in this review include the most relevant properties of amino acids including CO2 loading capacity, cyclic capacity, equilibrium constant, density, viscosity, dissociation constant, CO2 solubility, CO2 diffusivity, reaction kinetic between CO2 and amino acid salts, reaction rate constant, surface tension, heat of CO2 absorption, precipitation, toxicity, solvent degradation, and corrosion rate. This review provides the most recent information available in the literature on the potential of using amino acid salts as a solvent for CO2 capture which can help improve the performance of the CO2 capture process from flue gas streams.","[Ramezani, Rouzbeh; Di Felice, Renzo] Univ Genoa, Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Via Opera Pia 15, Genoa, Italy; [Mazinani, Saeed] Univ Bath, Ctr Adv Separat Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Genoa; University of Bath,"Ramezani, R (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Civil Chem & Environm Engn, Via Opera Pia 15, Genoa, Italy.",rouzbeh.ramezani@edu.unige.it,,,,,,,144,17,17,89,118,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0167-8299,2191-0235,,REV CHEM ENG,Rev.

Yet, there is a significant knowledge gap concerning the extentto which pastoral traditional ecological knowledge has changed over time at the global level. We aim to fill this gap through a systematicliterature review of 288 scientific studies on pastoral traditional ecological knowledge. We reviewed 152 papers in detail (selectedrandomly from the 288) for their content, and focused specifically on 61 papers that explicitly mentioned one of the four types ofknowledge transition (i.e., retention, erosion, adaptation, or hybridization). Studies on pastoral traditional knowledge represent lessthan 3% of all the scholarly literature on traditional ecological knowledge. Geographical distribution of the 288 case studies was largelybiased. Knowledge domains of pastoral knowledge such as herd and livestock management, forage and medicinal plants, and landscapeand wildlife were relatively equally covered; however, climate-related knowledge was less often studied. Of the 63 papers that explicitlymentioned transition of pastoral traditional ecological knowledge, 52 reported erosion, and only 11 studies documented explicitlyknowledge retention, adaptation, or hybridization of traditional knowledge. Thus, adaptation and hybridization was understudied,although some case studies showed that adaptation and hybridization of knowledge can efficiently help pastoralists navigate amongsocial-ecological changes. Based on the review, we found 13 drivers which were mentioned as the main reasons for knowledge transitionamong which social-cultural changes, formal schooling, abandonment of pastoral activities, and transition to a market economy weremost often reported. We conclude that future research should focus more on the diverse dynamics of pastoral traditional knowledge,be more careful in distinguishing the four knowledge transition types, and analyze how changes in knowledge impact change in pastoralpractices and lifestyles. Understanding these phenomena could help pastoralists' adaptations and support their stewardship of theirrangeland ecosystems and biocultural diversity.","[Sharifian, Abolfazl] Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran; [Sharifian, Abolfazl; Molnar, Zsolt] Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Fernandez-Llamazares, Alvaro; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fernandez-Llamazares, Alvaro; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Organismal & Evolutionary Res Program, Global Change & Conservat Lab, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Wario, Hussein T.] Ctr Res & Dev, Drylands, Kenya",Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Sharifian, A (corresponding author), Gorgan Univ Agr Sci & Nat Resources, Dept Rangeland & Watershed Management, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.;Sharifian, A (corresponding author), Inst Ecol & Bot, Ctr Ecol Res, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary.",abolfazlsharifiyan@gmail.com; alvaro.fernandez-llamazares@helsinki.fi; hussein.tadicha@crdd-kenya.org; molnar.zsolt@ecolres.hu; mar.cabeza@helsinki.fi,,"Fernandez-Llamazares, Alvaro/0000-0002-7813-0222; Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631","IUBS; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology from Iran [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00019]; project Effects of extensive grazing on vegetation in non-conventional pasture-lands (marshes and forests) [NKFIH K 119478]; IUBS through the GIPP project","IUBS; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology from Iran; project Effects of extensive grazing on vegetation in non-conventional pasture-lands (marshes and forests); IUBS through the GIPP project","We would like to give our appreciation to all the pastoral communities whose knowledge and participation provided the basis for this study.

With specific climate and environmental conditions in China, the environmental actions are classified into five categories and six intensity degrees. Globally a deemed-to-satisfy approach is adopted in this design code with appropriate consideration given to model-based analysis. For corrosive environments, including atmospheric and chloride environments, the classification of environmental actions is refined in detail on the basis of the involved mechanisms of deterioration processes.

Moreover, how climate-induced phenological and physiological change further affects carbon uptake in this region remains unclear. In this study, we first estimated GPP at 8-day intervals and a 0.5 degrees resolution from 2007 to 2015 over the TP based on an improved approach and GOME-2 sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) retrievals. The obtained SIF-based GPP coincided well with flux observations and two state of the art GPP products, with a regional carbon uptake of 0.62 +/- 0.04 PgC year(-1) or 307 +/- 22 gC m(-2) year(-1). With the SIF-based GPP, two phenological indicators (start and end date of the growing season, i.e., SGS and EGS) and one physiological indicator (maximum photosynthesis capacity, GPP(max)) were identified and their relative contributions to inter-annual GPP variability were further quantitatively separated using a multiple regression model. Advanced SGS, delayed EGS, and increasing GPPmax can all enhance carbon uptake and a combination of the three indicators can explain 72 +/- 20% of GPP inter-annual variability. The response of annual GPP to phenological and physiological variations has significant altitude dependence, as the decline of annual GPP in most of the area is dominated by the GPPmax decline, while the increase of annual GPP in the high-altitude area is dominated by the advanced SGS. The response of all three indicators to both temperature and precipitation variation has great spatial heterogeneity. Our study suggests that remote sensing of SIF can provide a unique opportunity to estimate GPP in regions with a lack of ground observations and that our enhanced understanding of the impact of the climate-induced phenological and physiological change on GPP variability in alpine ecosystems can improve GPP estimation in a changing climate.

Degree-day or temperature index models (TIMs) as well as energy balance models (EBMs) are conventional to quantify catchment runoff. Whereas the former exploit relationships between snow (and/or ice) melt and air temperatures, the latter rest upon quantifying melt as the deviation from heat balance equations. However, the 2 approaches contain distinct drawbacks. For example, increasing temporal resolution decreases the accuracy of TIMs, and no spatial variability is provided, whereas EBMs have large dataset requirements for climate, landscape and soil properties. Nevertheless, detailed knowledge about shifts in seasonal ablation times and spatial distribution of snow cover is crucial for understanding hydrological systems, plant distribution and various other research interests. Therefore, we propose a statistical model based on a combination of high resolution spatio-temporal climate datasets and climate-related topographic data, which were obtained by meteorological network stations, remote sensing and GIS analysis. The main objectives were to identify suitable inputs and to develop a robust binary snow distribution model that enables the mapping of major physical processes controlling snow accumulation, melt and stagnation in a high mountain environment in the Gaurishankar Conservation Area in Nepal. We used the random forest technique, which represents a state of the art machine learning algorithm. The snow distribution was predicted very accurately with high spatio-temporal resolution (daily on 0.5 x 0.5 km), with hit rates of around 90% and an overall model accuracy of 90.8% compared to independent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations.","[Weidinger, J.; Bechtel, B.; Boehner, J.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Gerlitz, L.] Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, German Res Ctr Geosci, GFZ, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",University of Hamburg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences,"Weidinger, J (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",johannes.weidinger@uni-hamburg.de,"Boehner, Juergen/I-9844-2014; Bechtel, Benjamin/H-9853-2014","Boehner, Juergen/0000-0002-0842-0152; Bechtel, Benjamin/0000-0001-8802-7934; Weidinger, Johannes/0000-0003-4354-7711","German Research Foundation (DFG) [GZ: BO 1333/4-1, SCHI 436/14-1]; Cluster of Excellence CliSAP [EXC177]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Cluster of Excellence CliSAP,"We are very grateful to local guides and Sherpa, especially Tenzin Sherpa and Dawa Chhiri Sherpa, who accompanied us on numerous field trips to our climate stations.

These artworks focus on the moving image as an immersive, architectonic construct, one that makes it possible to blur the boundary between space and time. They are cine -matic environments that create a space of spatial and temporal ambiguity, open to the performative role of the viewer in composing the unfolding narrative. The artworks presented here began in the crossover between art and science, technol-ogy and anthropology, exploring topics and incorporating methods from each area. Transdisciplinary processes play a critical role in this artistic research. These works reflect cinema approached as a multimodal field of possibilities in which montage motivates movement and focus through this field, creating a participa-tory composition of sight, sound, movement and memory that immerses viewers by actuating somatic perception. Shape, scale, immersion, interactivity, simulta-neity, embodiment, implementation and the manipulation of time create concrete metaphors that echo the multivalent content of the works: a collaboration with 300 tropical spiders to create a Kino, then letting the audience walk freely among them (or the spiders freely among the audience); an immersive environment enacting the space-time of glacial ice to experience the time of a different form of matter as somatosensory experience; a journey through the human history of the Moon, tran-scending time, political ideologies, realities and cultures as an encompassing field of simultaneous views and sounds; performing a 2000-year-old act of Thessalian magic on the skyline of Hong Kong. Combining the technological tools available to cinema and science, contrasting magnifications and speeds of observation reveal a material poetics beyond appearance.

The biodiversity of these ecosystems is endangered by several pressures resulting from agricultural and urban expansion, climate change, and the alteration of their hydrological cycle. In this study we assess the state-of-the-art regarding the impact of several stressor groups on the biodiversity of Mediterranean coastal wetlands (i.e., lagoons, marshes, estuaries). Particularly, we describe the impacts of eutrophication, chemical pollution, invasive species, salinization, and temperature rise, and analyze the existing literature regarding the impact of multiple stressors on these ecosystems. Our study denotes a clear asymmetry both in terms of study areas and stressors evaluated. The majority of studies focus on lagoons and estuaries of the north-west parts of the Mediterranean basin, while the African and the Asian coast have been less represented. Eutrophication and chemical pollution were the most studied stressors compared to others like temperature rise or species invasions. Most studies evaluating these stressors individually show direct or indirect effects on the biodiversity of primary producers and invertebrate communities, and changes in species dominance patterns that contribute to a decline of endemic populations. The few available studies addressing stressor interactions have shown non-additive responses, which are important to define appropriate ecosystem management and restoration measures. Finally, we propose research needs to advance our understanding on the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on Mediterranean coastal wetlands and to guide future interventions to protect biodiversity.

One of the main concerns with potential alterations in climate is the propensity for increases in the magnitude and frequency of extremes to occur. Even though precipitation is predicted to increase in some locations, in others precipitation is expected to decrease and evapotranspiration increase with air temperature, resulting in exacerbated drought in the future. Chemical [ozone (O-3) and other air contaminants] and subsequent physical alterations in the environment will have a profound effect on the 'disease triangle' (a favourable environment, a susceptible host and a virulent pathogen) and should be included in any analysis of biological response to climate change. The chemical and physical environment affects plant health and alters plant susceptibility to insect and pathogen attack through increased frequency, duration and severity of drought and reduction in host vigour. The potential effects of climate change and O3 on tree diseases with emphasis on the western United States are discussed. We describe a generalised modelling approach to incorporate the complexities of the 'disease triangle' into dynamic vegetation models.","[Chappelka, A.

The introduction of multiple distributed generation and storage resources, with a strong involvement of renewable energies, exposes the necessity of advanced metering or Smart Metering systems, able to manage and control those distributed resources. Due to the heterogeneity of the Smart Metering systems and the specific features of each grid, it is easy to find in the related literature a wide range of solutions with different features. This work describes the key elements in a Smart Metering system and compiles the most employed technologies and standards as well as their main features. Since Smart Metering systems can perform jointly with other activities, these growing initiatives are also addressed. Finally, a revision of the main trends in Smart Metering uses and deployments worldwide is included.","[Uribe-Perez, Noelia] Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol CIEMAT, Ctr Dev Renewable Energy Sources CEDER, Autovia de Navarra A15,Sal 56, Lubia 42290, Soria, Spain; [Hernandez, Luis] Univ Valladolid UVA, Dept Agr Engn & Forestry, Campus Univ Duques de Soria, Soria 42004, Spain; [de la Vega, David; Angulo, Itziar] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, ETSI Bilbao, Dept Commun Engn, Alda Urkijo S-N, Bilbao 48013, Spain","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas; University of Basque Country","Uribe-Perez, N (corresponding author), Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol CIEMAT, Ctr Dev Renewable Energy Sources CEDER, Autovia de Navarra A15,Sal 56, Lubia 42290, Soria, Spain.",noelia.uribe@ciemat.es; luis.hernandez.callejo@uva.es; david.delavega@ehu.es; itziar.angulo@ehu.es,"Angulo, Itziar/R-8412-2018; de la Vega, David/P-9192-2019; Callejo, Luis Hernández/D-6360-2016","Angulo, Itziar/0000-0002-7855-3516; de la Vega, David/0000-0003-4811-4173; Callejo, Luis Hernández/0000-0002-8822-2948; Uribe-Perez, Noelia/0000-0001-6154-1087",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [TEC2015-67868-C3-1-R]; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU); Microgrids with Renewable Distributed Generation (MIGEDIR) - Science and Technology for Development Iberoamerican Program (CYTED) [713RT0468],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU); Microgrids with Renewable Distributed Generation (MIGEDIR) - Science and Technology for Development Iberoamerican Program (CYTED),"This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (project TEC2015-67868-C3-1-R), the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) within the program for the specialization of the postdoctoral researcher staff, and Microgrids with Renewable Distributed Generation (MIGEDIR) (project 713RT0468), funded by the Science and Technology for Development Iberoamerican Program (CYTED).",,81,86,86,0,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The scenario simulations were driven by regionalized global general circulation model (GCM) data using several regional climate system models and forced by various future greenhouse gas emission and air- and river-borne nutrient load scenarios following either reference conditions or the BSAP. To estimate uncertainties in projections, the largest ever multi-model ensemble for the Baltic Sea comprising 58 transient simulations for the twenty-first century was assessed. Data from already existing simulations from different projects including regionalized GCM simulations of the third and fourth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change based on the corresponding Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects, CMIP3 and CMIP5, were collected. Various strategies to weigh the ensemble members were tested and the results for ensemble mean changes between future and present climates are shown to be robust with respect to the chosen metric. Although (1) the model simulations during the historical period are of different quality and (2) the assumptions on nutrient load levels during present and future periods differ between models considerably, the ensemble mean changes in biogeochemical variables in the Baltic proper with respect to nutrient load reductions are similar between the entire ensemble and a subset consisting only of the most reliable simulations. Despite the large spread in projections, the implementation of the BSAP will lead to a significant improvement of the environmental status of the Baltic Sea according to both weighted and unweighted ensembles. The results emphasize the need for investigating ensembles with many members and rigorous assessments of models' performance.","[Meier, H. E.

A growing body of scientific evidence now suggests that the implementation of the Montreal Protocol will have significant effects on climate over the next several decades, both by enabling stratospheric ozone recovery and by decreasing atmospheric concentrations of ODSs, which are greenhouse gases. Here, using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model, the Community Earth System Model (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) [CESM(WACCM)], it is shown that the Montreal Protocol, through its impact on atmospheric ODS concentrations, leads to a substantial decrease in Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) over the period 2006-65 relative to a hypothetical World Avoided'' scenario in which the Montreal Protocol has not been implemented. This SMB decrease produces an additional 25 mm of global sea level rise (GSLR) by the year 2065 relative to the present day. It is found, however, that the additional GSLR resulting from the relative decrease in Antarctic SMB is more than offset by a reduction in ocean thermal expansion, leading to a net mitigation of future GSLR due to the Montreal Protocol.","[Previdi, Michael; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Previdi, M (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA.",mprevidi@ldeo.columbia.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011",,NSF Division of Polar Programs [PLR 13-41657],NSF Division of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank two anonymous reviewers whose comments improved the manuscript.

The recent and projected polar warming, and its effects on the meridional temperature gradients, suggests a possible weakening of eddy heat fluxes. We here examine this question in reanalyses and state-of-the-art global climate models. In the Northern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly weakened over the last four decades. We further show that this weakening emerged from the internal variability around the year 2000, and we attribute it to increasing greenhouse gases. In contrast, in the Southern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly strengthened, and we link this strengthening to the recent multi-decadal cooling of Southern-Ocean surface temperatures. The inability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate such cooling prevents them from capturing the observed Southern Hemisphere strengthening of the eddy heat flux. This discrepancy between models and reanalyses provides a clear example of how model biases in polar regions can affect the midlatitude climate.","[Chemke, Rei; Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Chemke, R (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rc3101@columbia.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011",,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),R.C. and L.M.P. are founded by grants from the National Science Foundation to Columbia University.,,68,18,18,0,5,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2397-3722,,,NPJ CLIM ATMOS SCI,npj Clim.

To improve the accuracy of these longterm forecasts, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched the Subseasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo, a year-long real-time forecasting challenge in which participants aimed to skillfully predict temperature and precipitation in the western U.S. two to four weeks and four to six weeks in advance. Here we present and evaluate our machine learning approach to the Rodeo and release our SubseasonalRodeo dataset, collected to train and evaluate our forecasting system. Our system is an ensemble of two nonlinear regression models. The first integrates the diverse collection of meteorological measurements and dynamic model forecasts in the SubseasonalRodeo dataset and prunes irrelevant predictors using a customized multitask feature selection procedure. The second uses only historical measurements of the target variable (temperature or precipitation) and introduces multitask nearest neighbor features into a weighted local linear regression. Each model alone is significantly more accurate than the debiased operational U.S. Climate Forecasting System (CFSv2), and our ensemble skill exceeds that of the top Rodeo competitor for each target variable and forecast horizon. Moreover, over 2011-2018, an ensemble of our regression models and debiased CFSv2 improves debiased CFSv2 skill by 40-50% for temperature and 129-169% for precipitation. We hope that both our dataset and our methods will help to advance the state of the art in subseasonal forecasting.","[Hwang, Jessica; Orenstein, Paulo] Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cohen, Judah; Pfeiffer, Karl] Atmospher & Environm Res, Lexington, MA USA; [Mackey, Lester] Microsoft Res New England, Cambridge, MA USA",Stanford University; Atmospheric & Environmental Research; Microsoft,"Hwang, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jjhwang@stanford.edu; pauloo@stanford.edu; jcohen@aer.com; kpfeiffe@aer.com; lmackey@microsoft.com,,,National Science Foundation [AGS-1303647],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank the Subseasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo organizers for administering this challenge and Ernest Fraenkel for bringing our team together.

For example, approximately 40% of proteins in eukaryotic model organisms do not contain characterized domains (Gollery et al., 2006). Even proteins of known function are typically only characterized in the sense that they have a domain function, but provide no information on their biological role within the cell (e.g., activation, pathways or targets). Yet, as molecular ecologists, a common objective is to elucidate how organisms respond to environmental variation through changes in gene expression, including homoeostatic, acclimatory, and adaptive responses to environmental stressors, a challenge increased by poor protein ecological annotation. Now, in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Orsini et al. (2017) use the quintessential Daphnia system to characterize the differences in stress response in three genotypic backgrounds to common biotic and abiotic stressors found in nature. Using an optimized weighted gene co-expression network analysis, they link genes of unknown function to genes that they co-activate with and enrich for gene ontology.

Between ca. 15.6-15.2 cal ka BP, a lowstand was synchronous with Heinrich Event 1 and an intense drought across Eastern Africa. At ca. 15.2-15.2 cal ka BP a lake began to develop at the core site in response to wetter conditions, at the onset of the African Humid Period (AHP). However, in contrast to other lakes in eastern Africa, Hayk lake level fell around ca. 14.8 cal ka BP, indicating a climate shift towards aridity. The lake began filling again at ca. 12.3 cal ka BP and reached maximum water depth between ca. 12.0-10.0 cal ka BP. Lake level declined slowly during the Holocene, culminating in the termination of the AHP at Hayk between ca. 5.2-4.6 cal ka BP. In the late Holocene, ca. 2.2-1.3 cal ka BP, Lake Hayk was again deep and fresh with some evidence of short-term lake level variability. The palaeo-record from Lake Hayk indicates that while it experienced, to a broad degree, the same glacial-interglacial dynamics and sub-millennial shifts in climate found in other palaeolimnological records from eastern Africa, there are offsets in timing and rate of response. These differences reflect chronological discrepancies between records, as well as the varying climate sensitivities and site-specific factors of individual lake basins. This record highlights the different responses by lakes in a climatically vulnerable area of Ethiopia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The key idea of our methodology is to apply flexible quadratic penalties to regularize the likelihood function that incorporates both types of structural information. We prove the theoretical statistical properties of the proposed estimator, which generalizes several state-of-the-art sparse learning methods. Numerical examples are provided for the proposed estimator on synthetic data and on the statistical downscaling problem in climate research.","[Li, Yi; Ding, A.

Most water quality management applications were, however, developed using multispectral mid-spatial resolution satellites or coarse spatial resolution ocean colour satellites till now. This situation is about to change with a suite of upcoming imaging spectrometers being deployed from experimental satellites or from the International Space Station. We review the science of developing applications for inland and coastal aquatic ecosystems that often are a mixture of optically shallow and optically deep waters, with gradients of clear to turbid and oligotrophic to hypertrophic productive waters and with varying bottom visibility with and without macrophytes, macro-algae, benthic micro-algae or corals. As the spaceborne, airborne and in situ optical sensors become increasingly available and appropriate for aquatic ecosystem detection, monitoring and assessment, the science-based applications will need to be further developed to an operational level. The Earth Observation-derived information products will range from more accurate estimates of turbidity and transparency measures, chlorophyll, suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter concentration, to more sophisticated products such as particle size distributions, phytoplankton functional types or distinguishing sources of suspended and coloured dissolved matter, estimating water depth and mapping types of heterogeneous substrates. We provide an overview of past science, current state of the art and future directions so that early career scientists as well as aquatic ecosystem managers and associated industry groups may be prepared for the imminent deluge of imaging spectrometry data.","[Giardino, C.; Bresciani, M.] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm, CNR IREA, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Brando, V.

However, coastal ecosystems are threatened by human-induced pressures such as climate change and eutrophication. In the coastal zone, the fluxes and transformations of nutrients and carbon sustaining coastal ecosystem functions and services are strongly regulated by benthic biological and chemical processes. Thus, to understand and quantify how coastal ecosystems respond to environmental change, mechanistic modeling of benthic biogeochemical processes is required. Here, we discuss the present model capabilities to quantitatively describe how benthic fauna drives nutrient and carbon processing in the coastal zone. There are a multitude of modeling approaches of different complexity, but a thorough mechanistic description of benthic-pelagic processes is still hampered by a fundamental lack of scientific understanding of the diverse interactions between the physical, chemical and biological processes that drive biogeochemical fluxes in the coastal zone. Especially shallow systems with long water residence times are sensitive to the activities of benthic organisms. Hence, including and improving the description of benthic biomass and metabolism in sediment diagenetic as well as ecosystem models for such systems is essential to increase our understanding of their response to environmental changes and the role of coastal sediments in nutrient and carbon cycling. Major challenges and research priorities are (1) to couple the dynamics of zoobenthic biomass and metabolism to sediment reactive-transport in models, (2) to test and validate model formulations against real-world data to better incorporate the context-dependency of processes in heterogeneous coastal areas in models and (3) to capture the role of stochastic events.","[Ehrnsten, Eva; Sun, Xiaole; Humborg, Christoph; Norkko, Alf; Savchuk, Oleg P.; Gustafsson, Bo G.] Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ehrnsten, Eva; Humborg, Christoph; Norkko, Alf; Gustafsson, Bo G.] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, Hango, Finland; [Slomp, Caroline P.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Earth Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Timmermann, Karen] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Roskilde, Denmark; [Timmermann, Karen] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, Lyngby, Denmark",Stockholm University; University of Helsinki; Utrecht University; Aarhus University; Technical University of Denmark,"Ehrnsten, E (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Baltic Sea Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.;Ehrnsten, E (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, Hango, Finland.",eva.ehrnsten@su.se,"Norkko, Alf/L-8736-2019; Ehrnsten, Eva/GWU-7048-2022; Slomp, Caroline P/A-9406-2012; Slomp, Caroline/ABB-8856-2020; Gustafsson, Bo/GQH-3048-2022; Savchuk, Oleg/C-8628-2013; Humborg, Christoph/C-4756-2015","Norkko, Alf/0000-0002-9741-4458; Ehrnsten, Eva/0000-0002-8960-8252; Slomp, Caroline P/0000-0002-7272-0109; Slomp, Caroline/0000-0002-7272-0109; Savchuk, Oleg/0000-0002-3873-4662; Timmermann, Karen/0000-0001-5989-4692; Humborg, Christoph/0000-0002-0649-5599; Sun, Xiaole/0000-0003-2391-5572",EU; Academy of Finland [294853]; Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project; Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS COCOA project; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management; University of Helsinki; Stockholm University strategic fund for collaborative research (the Baltic Bridge initiative),EU(European Commission); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP project; Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS COCOA project; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management; University of Helsinki; Stockholm University strategic fund for collaborative research (the Baltic Bridge initiative),"This study received funding from the EU, the Academy of Finland and Formas through BONUS (Art 185) as part of the BONUS BALTICAPP and BONUS COCOA projects, and from the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management through their grant 1.11 -Measure for Marine and Water environment.

Parties of the Kyoto Protocol had the option to elect to account for direct human-induced carbon (C) sources and sinks from land management activities since 1990. The effect of age-class structure of a forest landscape resulting from past practices and disturbances before the reference year 1990 should be excluded, but methods for factoring out the effects of this age-class legacy on carbon emissions and removals are lacking. The legacy effect can be strong and can even overwhelm effects of post-1990 management. It therefore needs to be factored out, i.e., removed from the direct human-induced post-1990 effects. In this study we examine how the contributions to forest biomass carbon stock changes of (1) past (pre-1990) disturbances and harvest and (2) recent (post-1990) changes in forest management can be differentiated in present and future observable carbon dynamics in managed forest ecosystems. We also calculate the consequences of different accounting rules for the magnitude and direction of accountable C stock changes in European countries in the period 2013-2017. Different accounting approaches are compared in terms of applicability and their ability to provide incentives for management changes to increase carbon sinks and reduce carbon sources. We demonstrate implications of the various ways of accounting for a sample of European countries with different initial age-class structures. The current forest age-class distribution in countries determines whether and how many credits can be created by the various accounting approaches. We suggest an approach that includes a dynamic, forward-looking baseline as reference and list options to define such a baseline. Accounting of recent management change against such a baseline factors out the contribution of the legacy effect to accounting results and only rewards the effect of recent changes in forest management practices in support of climate change mitigation. We demonstrate that relatively simple, state-of-the-art forest models can factor out effects of past practices and past disturbances on present and future carbon stock changes. Factoring out of past practice effects is thus technically feasible but the numerical results are highly dependent on the choice of baseline which will be subject to negotiation. It is possible, however, to select a dynamic baseline thatrepresents business-as-usual, and to isolate and account for only the changes in management. Changes in accounting rules will always be advantageous for some countries and disadvantageous for others, but using a dynamic business-as-usual baseline effectively removes the legacy of pre-1990 age-class effects, and thus overcomes one of the acknowledged shortcomings of the current accounting approach.

Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

A major constraint to application of physiological knowledge for conservation of marine fishes is the limited knowledge base; international collaboration is needed to study the environmental physiology of a wider range of species. Multifactorial field and laboratory studies on biomarkers hold promise to relate ecophysiology directly to habitat quality and population status. The 'Fry paradigm' could have broad applications for conservation physiology research if it provides a universal mechanism to link physiological function with ecological performance and population dynamics of fishes, through effects of abiotic conditions on aerobic metabolic scope. The available data indicate, however, that the paradigm is not universal, so further research is required on a wide diversity of species. Fish physiologists should interact closely with researchers developing ecological models, in order to investigate how integrating physiological information improves confidence in projecting effects of global change; for example, with mechanistic models that define habitat suitability based upon potential for aerobic scope or outputs of a dynamic energy budget. One major challenge to upscaling from physiology of individuals to the level of species and communities is incorporating intraspecific variation, which could be a crucial component of species' resilience to global change. Understanding what fishes do in the wild is also a challenge, but techniques of biotelemetry and biologging are providing novel information towards effective conservation. Overall, fish physiologists must strive to render research outputs more applicable to management and decision-making. There are various potential avenues for information flow, in the shorter term directly through biomarker studies and in the longer term by collaborating with modellers and fishery biologists.","[McKenzie, David J.] IFREMER, UMR MARBEC CNRS, Ctr Marine Biodivers Exploitat & Conservat, IRD,UM, Pl E Bataillon Cc 093, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Axelsson, Michael] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Med Aregatan 18, S-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Chabot, Denis] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Maurice Lamontagne, Mont Joli, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada; [Claireaux, Guy] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Ctr Ifremer Bretagne, UMR LEMAR, Unite PFOM ARN, Zl Pointe Diable,CS 10070, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Corner, Richard A.] Longline Environm Ltd, 88 Wood St, London EC2V 7RS, England; [De Boeck, Gudrun] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Syst Physiol & Ecotoxicol Res SPHERE, Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Domenici, Paolo] CNR IAMC, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero, I-09072 Torregrande, Oristano, Italy; [Guerreiro, Pedro M.] Univ Algarve, CCMAR Ctr Marine Sci, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Hamer, Bojan] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Ctr Marine Res, Giordano Paliaga 5, Rovinj 52210, Croatia; [Jorgensen, Christian] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Jorgensen, Christian] Univ Bergen, Hjort Ctr Marine Ecosyst Dynam, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Killen, Shaun S.] Coll Med, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Nilsson, Goran E.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Michaelidis, Basile] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Dept Zool, Lab Anim Physiol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Peck, Myron A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Olbersweg 24, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Perez-Ruzafa, Angel] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol & Hydrol, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia, Spain; [Rijnsdorp, Adriaan D.; Teal, Lorna R.] IMARES, Inst Marine Resources & Ecosyst Studies, POB 68, NL-1970 AB Ijmuiden, Netherlands; [Shiels, Holly A.] Univ Manchester, Core Technol Facil, 46 Grafton St, Manchester M13 9NT, Lancs, England; [Steffensen, John F.; Svendsen, Morten B.

Each implementation level reduces logging emissions by a consistent proportion below the business-as-usual emissions baseline, which varies with harvest intensity. Level 1 reflects the best recorded emissions performance for each type of practice. Level 2 is more ambitious but feasible based on workshop feedback from concession managers and forestry experts, and confirmed by a recent demonstration. At Level 1 emissions can be reduced by 33%, avoiding emissions of 64.9 +/- 22.2 MgCO2 per ha harvested, on average. At Level 2 emissions can be reduced by 46%, avoiding 88.6 +/- 22.7 MgCO2 ha(-1). The greatest emissions reductions derive from (i) not felling trees that will be left in the forest due to commercial defects, and (ii) use of long-line cable winching to avoid bulldozer impacts. We also quantify the potential to avoid logging steep slopes and riparian habitats, while holding to our RIL-C accounting assumption that timber yields are maintained to avoid problems of leakage and product substitution. Logging damage to riparian areas < 50 m from perennial streams could be avoided by re-locating harvests to less sensitive areas that currently are not accessed due to lack of spatial planning. In all but the steepest concessions, all slopes > 40% could similarly be avoided. The combined areas of these sensitive habitats (steep slopes and riparian buffers) represented 16% of each cutting block on average. Implementation of RIL-C practices would deliver 8% (Level 1) and 11% (Level 2) of Indonesia's pledged reductions to their forest reference emissions level as a nationally determined contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement In concert with RIL-C practices, 30% of logging concession areas could be permanently protected from logging and conversion to minimize impacts on biodiversity, soils, and water quality, thereby expanding Indonesia's protected areas by one third and achieving 93% of Indonesia's Aichi Target 11 (the effective conservation of at least 17% of lands). Both these Paris Climate Agreement and Aichi outcomes could be delivered with no reductions in timber yields and substantial improvements in worker safety and sustainability of the natural forest timber sector.","[Griscom, Bronson W.; Ellis, Peter W.] Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Ave,Suite 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Burivalova, Zuzana] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Burivalova, Zuzana] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Halperin, James] US Embassy Jakarta, US Agcy Int Dev, Jl Medan Merdeka,Selatan 3-5, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia; [Marthinus, Delon] Governors Climate & Forests Task Force, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Runting, Rebecca K.] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Runting, Rebecca K.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ruslandi] Nature Conservancy, Graha Iskandarsyah 3rd Floor Jl Iskandarsyah Raya, Jakarta 12160, Indonesia; [Shoch, David] Terracarbon LLC, 707 E Jefferson St, Charlottesville, VA 22902 USA; [Putz, Francis E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118526, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Nature Conservancy; Princeton University; Princeton University; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); University of Queensland; University of Melbourne; The Nature Conservancy Indonesia; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Griscom, BW (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Ave,Suite 100, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.",bgriscom@tnc.org,"Runting, Rebecca/I-1470-2013","Runting, Rebecca/0000-0003-0614-1456; Ruslandi, Ruslandi/0000-0002-8918-1893",Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; International Paper Company,Doris Duke Charitable Foundation(Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF)); International Paper Company,"We thank staff of The Nature Conservancy and the Ministry of Forestry of Indonesia who provided essential in country support for this work including Oman Aliman, Lenny Christy, Mohammed Fajri, Herlina Hartanto, Fatmi Noor'an, Purnomo, Ingnatius Putu, Adjie Rachmad, Saipul Rahman, Ali Sasmirul, Sugy Sudiyanto, Umbar Sujoko, Alie Syopyan, Bambang Wahyudi, Wahjudi Wardojo, and Iwied Wahyulianto.

Energy consumption, as revealed by archival sources, is used as a substitute for climate records, on the assumption that higher temperature and therefore lower relative humidity will occur more frequently in churches with greater expenses for fuel. The quantified energy consumption is related to damage of wood and the painted layers of pulpits in 16 churches.

Thus, it was established that, to depend on beach morphodynamic stage, determined movement in the swash cycle will infl uence more directly in the morphological evolution, as well as development features. All these research aim towards the understanding the relationship between the evolution of a given process and variations in the swash zone. The evaluation of these studies show the important of this area for morphological development of the subaerial beach region, because this area determines every variation that will occur in the profile. The study also addresses new directions for researches related to swash, requiring more accurate and details approaches this environment, considering new technological methods and studies involving numerical modeling. Also emphasized the need for monitoring the swash zone in diff erent types of coasts, for more extensive knowledge on the subject.","[Ferreira Junior, Cicero Vicente] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Geol, Av Acad Helio Ramos S-N, BR-50740530 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Pereira, Pedro de Souza] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, Av Arquitetura S-N, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Ferreira, CV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Geol, Av Acad Helio Ramos S-N, BR-50740530 Recife, PE, Brazil.",c.vicentejr@yahoo.com.br; psppraias@gmail.com,"Junior, Cícero Vicente Ferreira/AAZ-7212-2020; Pereira, Pedro S./A-6656-2013","Junior, Cícero Vicente Ferreira/0000-0002-8333-7631; ",,,,,136,0,0,0,8,UNIAO GEOMORFOLOGIA BRASILEIRA,"UBERLANDIA, BRAZIL","UNIV FEDERAL UBERLANDIA, AV JOAO NAVES AVILA 2160, UBERLANDIA, BRAZIL, 00000, BRAZIL",1519-1540,2236-5664,,REV BRAS GEOMORFOL,Rev.

In liaison, the focus attributed to climatic mitigation has shifted towards the identification of how climatic adaptation can specifically prepare for an era prone to further climatological aggravations. Within this review study, the progress and growing opportunities for the interdisciplinary integration of human biometeorological aspects within existing and future local adaptation efforts are assessed. This encompassing assessment of the existing literature likewise scrutinises existing scientific hurdles in approaching existing/future human thermal wellbeing in local urban contexts. The respective hurdles are subsequently framed into new research opportunities concerning human biometeorology and its increasing interdisciplinary significance in multifaceted urban thermal adaptation processes. It is here where the assembly and solidification of 'scientific bridges' are acknowledged within the multifaceted ambition to ensuring a responsive, safe and thermally comfortable urban environment. Amongst other aspects, this review study deliberates upon numerous scientific interferences that must be strengthened, inclusively between the: (i) climatic assessments of both top-down and bottom-up approaches to local human thermal wellbeing; (ii) rooted associations between qualitative and quantitative aspects of thermal comfort in both outdoor and indoor environments; and (iii) efficiency and easy-to-understand communication with non-climatic experts that play an equally fundamental role in consolidating effective adaptation responses in an era of climate change.","[Nouri, Andre Santos] Univ Lisbon, Fac Architecture, Rua Sa Nogeuira, P-1349063 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nouri, Andre Santos] Bilkent Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Dept Interior Architecture & Environm Design, TR-06800 Bilkent, Turkey; [Matzarakis, Andreas] German Meteorol Serv, Res Ctr Human Biometeorol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Matzarakis, Andreas] Albert Ludwigs Univ, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Environm Meteorol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",Universidade de Lisboa; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; Deutscher Wetterdienst; University of Freiburg,"Matzarakis, A (corresponding author), German Meteorol Serv, Res Ctr Human Biometeorol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.;Matzarakis, A (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Environm Meteorol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",andrenouri@fa.ulisboa.pt; andreas.matzarakis@dwd.de,"Santos Nouri, A/AFK-0632-2022; Matzarakis, Andreas/AAO-2676-2021; Santos Nouri, A/AAF-7597-2022","Santos Nouri, A/0000-0001-8084-3339; Matzarakis, Andreas/0000-0003-3076-555X; Santos Nouri, A/0000-0001-8084-3339",,,,,235,5,5,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,DEC,2019,12,,,,,,134,10.3390/cli7120134,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli7120134,,,32,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KA1JX,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000505556200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite this, only a few studies have tried to directly estimate the possible advantages of highly resolved simulations for the study of past climate change. Motivated by such considerations, in this paper we present a set of high-resolution simulations for different time slices of the mid-to-late Holocene performed over Europe using the state-of-the-art regional climate model COSMO-CLM. After proposing and testing a model configuration suitable for paleoclimate applications, the aforementioned mid-to-late Holocene simulations are compared against a new pollen-based climate reconstruction data set, covering almost all of Europe, with two main objectives: testing the advantages of high-resolution simulations for paleoclimatic applications, and investigating the response of temperature to variations in the seasonal cycle of insolation during the mid-to-late Holocene. With the aim of giving physically plausible interpretations of the mismatches between model and reconstructions, possible uncertainties of the pollen-based reconstructions are taken into consideration. Focusing our analysis on near-surface temperature, we can demonstrate that concrete advantages arise in the use of highly resolved data for the comparison against proxy-reconstructions and the investigation of past climate change. Additionally, our results reinforce previous findings showing that summertime temperatures during the mid-to-late Holocene were driven mainly by changes in insolation and that the model is too sensitive to such changes over Southern Europe, resulting in drier and warmer conditions. However, in winter, the model does not correctly reproduce the same amplitude of changes evident in the reconstructions, even if it captures the main pattern of the pollen data set over most of the domain for the time periods under investigation. Through the analysis of variations in atmospheric circulation we suggest that, even though the wintertime discrepancies between the two data sets in some areas are most likely due to high pollen uncertainties, in general the model seems to underestimate the changes in the amplitude of the North Atlantic Oscillation, overestimating the contribution of secondary modes of variability.","[Russo, Emmanuele; Cubasch, Ulrich] FU Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Karl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Russo, E (corresponding author), FU Berlin, Inst Meteorol, Karl Heinrich Becker Weg 6-10, D-12165 Berlin, Germany.",emmanuele.russo@met.fu-berlin.de,"Russo, Emmanuele/AAC-8934-2020","Cubasch, Ulrich/0000-0001-9628-4666",Cluster of Excellence Topoi - The Formation and Transformation of Space and Knowledge in Ancient Civilizations,Cluster of Excellence Topoi - The Formation and Transformation of Space and Knowledge in Ancient Civilizations,"The authors are grateful to the two anonymous referees for their constructive comments that helped to considerably improve the manuscript.

Variability in entomological parameters, biting rates and entomological inoculation rates (EIR) have been strongly associated with attack rates in children. The goal of this study was to assess the weather's impact on weekly biting and EIR in the endemic area of Kisian, Kenya. Entomological data collected by the U.S. Army from March 1986 through June 1988 at Kisian, Kenya was analysed with concurrent weather data from nearby Kisumu airport. A soil moisture model of surface-water availability was used to combine multiple weather parameters with landcover and soil features to improve disease prediction. Modelling soil moisture substantially improved prediction of biting rates compared to rainfall; soil moisture lagged two weeks explained up to 45% of An. gambiae biting variability, compared to 8% for raw precipitation. For An. funestus, soil moisture explained 32% variability, peaking after a 4-week lag. The interspecies difference in response to soil moisture was significant (P < 0.00001). A satellite normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) of the study site yielded a similar correlation (r(2) = 0.42 An. gambiae). Modelled soil moisture accounted for up to 56% variability of Art. gambiae EIR, peaking at a lag of six weeks. The relationship between temperature and An. gambiae biting rates was less robust; maximum temperature r(2) = -0.20, and minimum temperature r(2) = 0.12 after lagging one week. Benefits of hydrological modelling ore compared to raw weather parameters and to satellite NDVI. These findings can improve both current malaria risk assessments and those based on El Nino forecasts or global climate change model projections.","Johns Hopkins Sch Hyg & Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Johns Hopkins Sch Hyg & Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; Johns Hopkins Univ, Appl Phys Lab, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Climate Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, TALA Res Grp, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Univ Delaware, Dept Geog, Ctr Climat Res, Newark, DE 19716 USA; Tulane Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Trop Med, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Oxford; University of Delaware; Tulane University,"Patz, JA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Sch Hyg & Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",jpatz@jhsph.edu,"Hay, Simon Iain/F-8967-2015","Hay, Simon Iain/0000-0002-0611-7272","NIAID NIH HHS [AI29000] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [R01AI029000, R21AI029000, R22AI029000] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",NIAID NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),,,56,101,102,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1360-2276,,,TROP MED INT HEALTH,Trop.

The simulation is compared to observations and to the well-documented simulation by the standard CCSM3, which uses the Eulerian spectral method for the atmospheric dynamics. The atmospheric component in the simulation herein uses a 1 degrees latitude X 1.25 degrees longitude grid, which is a slightly finer resolution than the T85-grid used in the spectral transform. As in the T85 simulation, the ocean and ice models use a nominal 1-degree grid. Although the physical parameterizations are the same and the resolution is comparable to the standard model, substantial testing and slight retuning were required to obtain an acceptable control simulation. There are significant improvements in the simulation of the surface wind stress and sea surface temperature. Improvements are also seen in the simulations of the total variance in the tropical Pacific, the spatial pattern of ice thickness distribution in the Arctic, and the vertically integrated ocean circulation in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The results herein demonstrate that the FV version of the CCSM coupled model is a state-of-the-art climate model whose simulation capabilities are in the class of those used for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. The simulated climate is very similar to that of the T85 version in terms of its biases, and more like the T85 model than the other IPCC models.","[Bala, G.; Mirin, A.; Achutarao, Krishna; Bader, D.; Gleckler, P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Energy & Environm Directorate, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Rood, R.

More recently, black carbon has been identified as a major, ongoing contributor to anthropogenic climate change, thus making historical emission inventories of black carbon an essential tool for assessing past climate sensitivity and modeling future climate scenarios. Current estimates of black carbon emissions for the early industrial era have high uncertainty, however, because direct environmental sampling is sparse before the mid-1950s. Using photometric reflectance data of >1,300 bird specimens drawn from natural history collections, we track relative ambient concentrations of atmospheric black carbon between 1880 and 2015 within the US Manufacturing Belt, a region historically reliant on coal and dense with industry. Our data show that black carbon levels within the region peaked during the first decade of the 20th century. Following this peak, black carbon levels were positively correlated with coal consumption through midcentury, after which they decoupled, with black carbon concentrations declining as consumption continued to rise. The precipitous drop in atmospheric black carbon at midcentury reflects policies promoting burning efficiency and fuel transitions rather than regulating emissions alone. Our findings suggest that current emission inventories based on predictive modeling underestimate levels of atmospheric black carbon for the early industrial era, suggesting that the contribution of black carbon to past climate forcing may also be underestimated. These findings build toward a spatially dynamic emission inventory of black carbon based on direct environmental sampling.","[DuBay, Shane G.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [DuBay, Shane G.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Life Sci Sect, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Fuldner, Carl C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Art Hist, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago); University of Chicago,"Dubay, SG (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Dubay, SG (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Life Sci Sect, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.;Fuldner, CC (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Art Hist, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dubaysg@uchicago.edu; cfuldner@uchicago.edu,,,"Arts, Science + Culture Initiative at the University of Chicago","Arts, Science + Culture Initiative at the University of Chicago","We thank contributors past and present to natural history collections.

The limited visibility of data on long-term human interactions with climate change in global change research could be overcome through a 'new social contract', a two-way movement between global change and historical disciplines to, 1) make use of, and apply, historical data to contemporary climate-related challenges, 2) design robust interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary research, 3) publish synthesised research in high-impact climate-adaptation journals, and 4) communicate research to the public in cultural history museums.","[Jackson, Rowan C.; Dugmore, Andrew J.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Geog, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland; [Jackson, Rowan C.; Riede, Felix] Aarhus Univ, Sch Culture & Soc, Dept Archaeol & Heritage Studies, Ctr Environm Humanities, Moesgard Alle 20, DK-8270 Hojbjerg, Denmark; [Dugmore, Andrew J.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Human Ecodynam Res Ctr, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Dugmore, Andrew J.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Doctoral Program Anthropol, 365 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Dugmore, Andrew J.] Washington State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Coll Hall 150,POB 644910, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Riede, Felix] Art Res Ctr, Inst Biosci, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Riede, Felix] Aarhus Univ, BIOCHANGE Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",University of Edinburgh; Aarhus University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Washington State University; Aarhus University,"Jackson, RC (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Dept Geog, Sch Geosci, Drummond St, Edinburgh EH8 9XP, Midlothian, Scotland.",rowan.jackson@ed.ac.uk,"Riede, Felix/N-5990-2019","Riede, Felix/0000-0002-4879-7157",University of Edinburgh - National Science Foundation of America [1202692]; Danish Council for Independent Research [6107-00059B]; Aarhus University - National Science Foundation of America [1202692]; Aarhus University,University of Edinburgh - National Science Foundation of America; Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Aarhus University - National Science Foundation of America; Aarhus University,"We acknowledge the support of the ExEDE Doctoral Training Programme between the University of Edinburgh and Aarhus University (RJ), financial support provided by the National Science Foundation of America, (through grant 1202692 'Comparative Island Ecodynamics in the North Atlantic') (AJD).

This situation implies an accepted flood risk for any greater rainfall event. This risk is often underestimated as factors such as city growth and climate change are ignored. But even major structural changes cannot guarantee that urban drainage networks would cope with all future rain events. Thus, being able to forecast urban flooding in real time is one of the main issues of integrated flood risk management. Runoff and hydraulic models can be essential elements of flood forecast systems, as an active part of the system or as studying tools. This paper gives an overview of current available options for pluvial flood modelling in urban areas, from basic estimations with a one-dimensional urban drainage model to detailed flood process representation with one dimensional-two dimensional hydrodynamic coupled models. Each type of modelling solution is described with pros and cons regarding urban flood analysis. The paper then elaborates on real-time flood forecast systems and the influence of their main components. A classification of real-time urban flood systems is given based on the use of urban models, i.e. empirical scenarios, pre-simulated scenarios and real-time simulations. A review of existing operational systems is done using this classification.","[Henonin, Justine; Mark, Ole] DHI, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark; [Russo, Beniamino] CLABSA, Barcelona 08038, Spain; [Gourbesville, Philippe] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Polytech Nice Sophia, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Henonin, J (corresponding author), DHI, Agern Alle 5, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",jsh@dhigroup.com,"Gourbesville, Philippe/CAG-9813-2022; Russo, Beniamino/Z-6372-2019","Gourbesville, Philippe/0000-0002-1377-6575; Russo, Beniamino/0000-0001-9437-0085",EU [244047],EU(European Commission),"The authors would like to thank all the CORFU partners for their valuable input and comments.

Projections of further changes in the SOS for the 21st century under certain emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs) are useful for improving understanding of the consequences of global warming. In this study, we first evaluate a linear relationship between the SOS (defined using the normalized difference vegetation index) and the April temperature for most land areas of the Northern Hemisphere for 1982-2008. Based on this relationship and the ensemble projection of April temperature under RCPs from the latest state-of-the-art global coupled climate models, we show the possible changes in the SOS for most of the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century. By around 2040-59, the SOS will have advanced by -4.7 days under RCP2.6, -8.4 days under RCP4.5, and -10.1 days under RCP8.5, relative to 1985-2004. By 2080-99, it will have advanced by -4.3 days under RCP2.6, -11.3 days under RCP4.5, and -21.6 days under RCP8.5. The geographic pattern of SOS advance is considerably dependent on that of the temperature sensitivity of the SOS. The larger the temperature sensitivity, the larger the date-shift-rate of the SOS.","[Xia Jiangjiang; Yan Zhongwei; Jia Gensuo; Zhang Anzhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm East Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zeng Heqing] Minist Environm Protect Jiuzhaigou Country, Beijing 623400, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jones, Philip Douglas] Univ E Anglia, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Jones, Philip Douglas] King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia; [Jones, Philip Douglas] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Meteorol, Jeddah 21413, Saudi Arabia; [Zhou Wen] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Guy Carpenter Asia Pacific Climate Impact Ctr, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; University of East Anglia; King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University; City University of Hong Kong","Xia, JJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm East Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xiajj@tea.ac.cn,"Zhang, Anzhi/D-1080-2014; Zhou, Wen/C-3750-2012; Yan, Zhongwei/AAF-7451-2020; Jia, Gensuo/AAL-2681-2020; Jones, Philip Douglas/C-8718-2009","Zhou, Wen/0000-0002-3297-4841; Yan, Zhongwei/0000-0003-0638-137X; Jia, Gensuo/0000-0001-5950-9555; Jones, Philip Douglas/0000-0001-5032-5493; Zhang, Anzhi/0000-0002-1676-2240",CAS Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues [XDA05090000]; CityU Strategic Research [7004164]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41405082],CAS Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues; CityU Strategic Research(City University of Hong Kong); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the CAS Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues (Grant No. XDA05090000), CityU Strategic Research (Grant No. 7004164), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 41405082).",,40,12,12,3,37,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

At first, we examine the ability of the model in reproducing the observed relationship between the anomalies of rainfall and large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with interannual variability, by using a 1000-yr control integration of the model. Then we document the changes in East Asian rainfall and associated circulation/specific humidity response to global warming, and find rainfall increase is accompanied by anomalous southerly and more moisture over the coastal East Asia. The good simulation of mean climate and the reproducibility of the relationship between precipitation and circulation associated with interannual variability over East Asia by the model give more credibility for regional climate change signals.","[Lu, Riyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CMSR, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Lu, Riyu] LASG, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Dong, Buwen] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading, Berks, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading","Lu, R (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CMSR, POB 9804, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",lr@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [40475025]; National Centre for Atmospheric Science [GOCE-CT-2003-505539],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Centre for Atmospheric Science,The data of transient climate response were obtained from the website of the IPCC model output for the Fourth Assessment Report.

This paper investigates how this process is modified at the surface when mesoscale ocean eddies are present, using a state-of-the-art high-resolution climate model with reasonable fidelity in the Southern Ocean. The method employed is to coarse-grain the high-resolution model fields to remove eddy signatures, and compare the results with those from the full model fields. This method shows that eddies reduced the WMT by 2-4 Sv (10%-20%; 1 Sv 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) over a wide range of densities, from typical values of 20 Sv in the smoothed case. The corresponding water mass formation was reduced by 40% at one particular density increment, namely, between 1026.4 and 1026.5 kg m(-3), which corresponds to the lighter end of the range of Indian Ocean Mode Water in the model. The effect of eddies on surface WMT is decomposed into three terms: direct modulation of the density outcrops, then indirectly, by modifying the air-sea density flux, and the combined effect of the two, akin to a covariance. It is found that the first and third terms dominate, i.e., smoothing the outcrops alone has a significant effect, as does the combination of smoothing both outcrops and density flux distributions, but smoothing density flux fields alone has little effect. Results from the coarse-graining method are compared to an alternative approach of temporally averaging the data. Implications for climate model resolution are also discussed.","[Small, R.

This emphasises the need for a fast transition to energy-efficient air-conditioning alternatives in buildings. The radiant chilled ceilings (RCCs) embedded with phase change materials (PCMs), owing to the prudent use of energy, large capacity of thermal energy storage, the ability of peak load shifting, and the establishment of thermal comfort, have been introduced as a more sustainable cooling technology. This review aims to identify the state of PCM embedded radiant chilled ceiling (PCM-RCC) for space cooling based on the available literature. To this aim, the operating characteristics and various types of RCCs are critically reviewed. PCM fundamentals and their suitability for building applications are described. This article then focuses on PCM-RCC potentials regarding energy savings, peak load shifting, and thermal comfort. It also discusses various PCM-RCC simulation models. The effects of critical design and operating variables on the system performance are explained as well. It was found that PCM-RCC can be more energy-efficient than that of the conventional all-air system. The main reason is its capability of providing thermal comfort through direct radiant cooling, which covers cooling loads during daytime and subsequently rejects heat during nighttime. However, the system design and operating variables should be carefully selected, since the energy performance is highly affected by the thermal storage capacity and PCM charging/discharging process.","[Mousavi, Seyedmostafa; Rismanchi, Behzad; Aye, Lu] Univ Melbourne, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Fac Engn & Informat Technol FEIT, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Brey, Stefan] InvAus Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Rismanchi, B (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Grp, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Fac Engn & Informat Technol FEIT, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",Brismanchi@unimelb.edu.au,"Mousavi, Seyedmostafa/AAJ-7207-2020; Aye, Lu/J-8733-2013; Rismanchi, Behzad/B-5266-2010","Mousavi, Seyedmostafa/0000-0001-5793-5817; Aye, Lu/0000-0002-5495-1683; Rismanchi, Behzad/0000-0001-8805-1627","University of Melbourne, Australia","University of Melbourne, Australia(University of Melbourne)","Seyedmostafa Mousavi would like to thank The University of Melbourne, Australia, for providing a Melbourne Research Scholarship (MRS) award.",,173,6,6,6,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Accurate short-, medium-, and long-term forecasts of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are crucial not only for quantifying the impacts of climate change on the water and energy balance, but also for real-time estimation of crop water demand and irrigation water allocation in agriculture. Despite considerable advances in satellite remote sensing technology and the availability of long ground-measured and remotely sensed ETa timeseries, real-time ETa forecasts are deficient. Applying a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approach, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were employed to nowcast (realtime) and forecast (ahead of time) ETa based on (1) major meteorological and ground-measured (i.e., soil moisture) input variables and (2) long ETa time-series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer (MODIS) onboard of the NASA Aqua satellite. The conventional LSTM and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) DL models were evaluated for seven distinct climatic zones across the contiguous United States. The employed LSTM and ConvLSTM models were trained and evaluated with data from the National Climate Assessment-Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS) and with MODIS/Aqua Net Evapotranspiration MYD16A2 product data. The obtained results indicate that when major atmospheric and soil moisture input variables are used for the conventional LSTM models, they yield accurate daily ETa forecasts for short (1, 3, and 7 days) and medium (30 days) time scales, with normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) of less than 10% and greater than 0.77, respectively. At the watershed scale, the univariate ConvLSTM models yielded accurate weekly spatiotemporal ETa forecasts (mean NRMSE less than 6.4% and NSE greater than 0.66) with higher computational efficiency for various climatic conditions. The employed models enable precise forecasts of both the current and future states of ETa, which is crucial for understanding the impact of climate change on rapidly depleting water resources.","[Babaeian, Ebrahim] Univ Florida, Dept Soil Water & Ecosyst Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Babaeian, Ebrahim; Tuller, Markus] Univ Arizona, Dept Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Paheding, Sidike] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Appl Comp, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Siddique, Nahian] Purdue Univ Northwest, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hammond, IN 46323 USA; [Devabhaktuni, Vijay K.] Univ Maine, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Orono, ME 04469 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Arizona; Michigan Technological University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Babaeian, E (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Soil Water & Ecosyst Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ebabaeian@ufl.edu,,,United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2020-67019-31028]; USDA NIFA [ARZT-1370600-R21-189],United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) under grant #2020-67019-31028, and from the USDA NIFA Hatch/Multi-State project #ARZT-1370600-R21-189.",,86,3,3,29,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

The Greenland ice sheet could be an important contributor to future sea-level rise, because of its large volume and its high sensitivity to surface air temperature increases. Frameworks for the integrated climate risk management often require fast, simplified treatments of sea-level rise, in particular for estimating the risks associated with low probabilities but, potentially high impacts. State-of-the-art ice sheet models provide important insights, but are often computationally too demanding to evaluate tail-area risks. Here we present SIMPLE, a physically motivated model of the Greenland ice sheet in response to temperature changes. SIMPLE can skillfully reproduce the results from a three-dimensional ice sheet model and outperforms existing simple models, after similar calibration. We anticipate that SIMPLE will be calibrated to other ice sheet models and can provide a fast approximation (emulator) for such models in studies that require many model evaluations.

Given that vegetation is most effective when it is healthy, stormwater harvesting and retention strategies (such as water sensitive urban design) could be used to support vegetation and promote ET. This study presents the implementation of a vegetated lined bio-filtration system (BFS) combined with a rainwater tank (RWT) and urban irrigation system in the single-layer urban canopy model Community Land Model-Urban. Runoff from roof and impervious road surface fractions is harvested and used to support an adequate soil moisture level for vegetation in the BFS. In a first stage, modelled soil moisture dynamics are evaluated and found reliable compared to observed soil moisture levels from biofiltration pits in Smith Street, Melbourne (Australia). Secondly, the impact of BFS, RWT and urban irrigation on ET is illustrated for a two-month period in 2012 using varying characteristics for all components. Results indicate that (i) a large amount of stormwater is potentially available for indoor and outdoor water demands, including irrigation of urban vegetation, (ii) ET from the BFS is an order of magnitude larger compared to the contributions from the impervious surfaces, even though the former only covers 10% of the surface fraction and (iii) attention should be paid to the cover fraction and soil texture of the BFS, size of the RWT and the surface fractions contributing to the collection of water in the RWT. Overall, this study reveals that this model development can effectuate future research with state-of-the-art urban climate models to further explore the benefits of vegetated biofiltration systems as a water sensitive urban design tool optimised with an urban irrigation system to maintain healthy vegetation.

Taking into account the rareness, limitations and shortcomings of the studies on glazing units of the Trombe walls and the advances in glazing technologies of the buildings, in this study physical and thermal properties of the utilized glazing units with advanced technologies and innovative configurations were investigated with focus on maintaining the highly passive functionality of the Trombe walls. Moreover, contrary to the largest extent of the former studies, the performances of the configurations in cold climates were studied annually with detailed focus on thermal requirements on different periods. Thus, wide ranges of numerical models were developed with validated methods and approaches. In this regard, novel Trombe walls with various window-to-wall ratios have been evaluated, and the impacts of different structural and spectral specifications are studied which is unprecedented. The annual heating, cooling, overheating, and comfort periods have been assessed distinctively, and solutions for boosting the efficiency of the prevalent Trombe walls through improving the specifications of the glazing units are presented. It was found that the application of Trombe walls with advanced glazing units leads to reduction of the heating period (48.8%), and improvement of the comfort conditions (23.9%), however it increases the cooling (22.7%) and overheating (2.2%) periods averagely. The physical properties (reduction ofwindow-to-wall ratios) is the most effective on improvement of comfort conditions (32%), and cooling periods (35%), however the structural properties of the glazing units are the most influential on reduction of the overheating periods (up to 12.2%). This study proves the undesirable performance of the conventional Trombe wall assemblies (window-to-wall ratio of 99%) by considering the annual assessments rather than focusing on heating period.","[Pourghorban, Arash] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Asoodeh, Hedyeh] Univ Art, Fac Architecture & Urbanism, Dept Interior Architecture, Tehran, Iran",Monash University,"Pourghorban, A (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",arashpourghorban@yahoo.com,"Pourghorban, Arash/GZK-3240-2022","Pourghorban, Arash/0000-0003-1177-9921",,,,,69,6,6,8,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-1388,2213-1396,,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

The Arctic amplification decreases the meridional temperature gradient, and simultaneously decreases static stability. These changes in the meridional temperature gradient and in the static stability have opposing effects on baroclinicity. The temperature increase at the upper tropospheric lower latitudes tends to increase the meridional temperature gradient and simultaneously increase static stability, which have opposing effects on baroclinicity as well. In this study, a dry idealized general circulation model with a modified Newtonian cooling scheme, which allows any chosen zonally symmetric temperature distribution to be simulated, is used to study the effect of Arctic amplification and lower-latitude upper-level warming on eddy activity. Due to the interplay between the static stability and meridional temperature gradient on atmospheric baroclinicity changes, and their opposing effect on atmospheric baroclinicity, it is found that both the Arctic amplification and lower-latitude upper-level warming could potentially lead to both decreases and increases in eddy activity, depending on the exact prescribed temperature modifications. Therefore, to understand the effect of global warming-like temperature trends on eddy activity, the zonally symmetric global warming temperature projections from state-of-the-art models are simulated. It is found that the eddy kinetic energy changes are dominated by the lower-latitude upper-level warming, which tends to weaken the eddy kinetic energy due to increased static stability. On the other hand, the eddy heat flux changes are dominated by the Arctic amplification, which tends to weaken the eddy heat flux at the lower levels.","[Yuval, Janni] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kaspi, Yohai] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Rehovot, Israel",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Weizmann Institute of Science,"Yuval, J (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",yaniyuval@gmail.com,,"Kaspi, Yohai/0000-0003-4089-0020",Israeli Science Foundation [1819/16]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [820829],Israeli Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme,This research has been supported by the Israeli Science Foundation (Grant 1819/16) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement 820829 (CONSTRAIN project).

The federal government released the strengthened climate plan in 2020, which emphasizes using nature-based solutions (NBSs) to combat the effects of UHI phenomenon. Here, the effects of two NBSs techniques are reviewed and analysed: increasing surface greenery/vegetation (ISG) and increasing surface reflectivity (ISR). Policymakers have the challenge of selecting appropriate NBSs to meet a wide range of objectives within the urban environment and Canadian-specific knowledge of how NBSs can perform at various scales is lacking. As such, this state-of-the-art review intends to provide a snapshot of the current understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the implantation of NBSs in urban spaces as well as a review of the current techniques used to model, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of UHI under evolving climate conditions. Thus, if NBSs are to be adopted to mitigate UHI effects and extreme summertime temperatures in Canadian municipalities, an integrated, comprehensive analysis of their contributions is needed. As such, developing methods to quantify and evaluate NBSs' performance and tools for the effective implementation of NBSs are required.","[Hayes, Alexander Thomas; Jandaghian, Zahra; Lacasse, Michael A.; Gaur, Abhishek; Lu, Henry; Laouadi, Abdelaziz] Natl Res Council Canada, Construct Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada; [Ge, Hua; Wang, Liangzhu] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",National Research Council Canada; Concordia University - Canada,"Hayes, AT (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Canada, Construct Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada.",alexander.hayes@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca; zahra.jandaghian@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca; michael.lacasse@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca; abhishek.gaur@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca; henry.lu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca; abdelaziz.laouadi@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca; hua.ge@concordia.ca; leon.wang@concordia.ca,"; Lacasse, Michael/N-3444-2017","Lu, Henry/0000-0002-5460-223X; Hayes, Alexander Thomas/0000-0001-6333-7426; Lacasse, Michael/0000-0001-7640-3701; Wang, Leon/0000-0002-0653-3612",Infrastructure Canada under National Research Council of Canada's (NRC's) Climate Resilient Built Environment Initiative,Infrastructure Canada under National Research Council of Canada's (NRC's) Climate Resilient Built Environment Initiative,This project was made possible through funding from Infrastructure Canada under National Research Council of Canada's (NRC's) Climate Resilient Built Environment Initiative.,,80,3,3,14,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,JUL,2022,7,,,,,,925,10.3390/buildings12070925,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12070925,,,15,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,3H8SP,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000832300700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reliable trajectory prediction can be used to perceive potential risks and ensure navigation efficiency. However, many existing studies have not fully considered the impact of complex ocean environmental factors and have only focused on local regions, which are difficult to extend to a global scale. To this end, we propose a deep learning vessel trajectory prediction method fusing discretized meteorological data (TripleConvTransformer). First, we clean the automatic identification system data to form a high-quality spatiotemporal trajectory dataset. Then, we fuse the trajectory data with the meteorological data after feature discretization to deeply mine the motion information of ocean-going ships. Finally, we design three modules, the global convolution, local convolution, and trend convolution modules, based on the simplified transformer model to capture multiscale features. We compare TripleConvTransformer with state-of-the-art prediction models. The experimental results show that in the prediction of the trajectory points in the next 90 min, the smallest root mean square error in terms of longitude and latitude and the highest overall prediction accuracy are achieved using TripleConvTransformer. Our method not only fully considers the influence of meteorological factors in the ocean-going process but also effectively extracts the important information hidden in the data, thus achieving accurate trajectory prediction on a global scale.","[Huang, Peng; Wu, Xi] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiong; Wang, Dong; Wang, Mingqing; Huang, Xiaomeng] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ,Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Information Technology; Tsinghua University,"Wu, X (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;Huang, XM (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ,Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hxm@tsinghua.edu.cn; wuxi@cuit.edu.cn,"Huang, Peng/GRS-6999-2022",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFC3101600, 2020YFA0607900, 2020YFA0608001, 2020YFA0608003]; Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Marine Science and Numerical Modeling [2020-ZD-05]; National Science Foundation of China [42075142, 42125503, 42075137]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2020JDTD0020, 2019ZDZX0007]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M701838]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Marine Science and Numerical Modeling; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Science and Technology Program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2021YFC3101600, 2020YFA0607900, 2020YFA0608001, and 2020YFA0608003, in part by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Marine Science and Numerical Modeling under Grant 2020-ZD-05, in part by the National Science Foundation ofChinaunderGrant42075142,42125503, and 42075137, inpartby the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2020JDTD0020 and 2019ZDZX0007, and in part by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2021M701838.",,53,0,0,15,15,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The record commences at c. 16 200 cal a bp following glacier retreat in response to climatic warming. However, cooler conditions persisted during the Late Glacial period. The onset of more temperate conditions after c. 12 390 cal abp is indicated by the arrival of southern beech forest and later establishment at c. 10 640 cal abp, but the woodland growth was restricted by lower levels of effective moisture. The climate signal is then truncated by a rapid marine incursion at c. 8640 cal abp which lasted until a more gradual emergence of the coast at c. 6600 cal abp. During this period the pollen record appears to be dominated by the southern beech woodland. A punctuated hydroseral succession follows the isolation of the site from the sea leading to the re-establishment of a peat bog. Between c. 5770 cal abp and the present there were several periods of short rapid climatic change leading to drier conditions, probably as a result of late Holocene periods of climatic warming.","[McCulloch, R.

Doing so, the paper demonstrates how the artist collective reacted to the socio-political structuring of the physical space in their own political mode of aesthetics. The site-specific works of the group attend to and confront the museum space to such an extent that the intervened space becomes Liberate Tate's principal medium. Through their horizontal arrangement mode, choice of messy, dirty, and viscous materials, and approach to nature, culture, and history as inseparable concepts, Liberate Tate's site-specific performances challenge the hegemonic neoliberal rhetoric of Tate Modern. The contrasts and conflicts Liberate Tate introduces against the visual discourse of Turbine Hall not only reveals the dominant political, financial, and social order of the space but also transforms the museum albeit temporarily into a truly public space of democracy.","[Pinar, Ekin] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Architecture, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Pinar, E (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Architecture, Ankara, Turkey.",epinar@sas.upenn.edu,"Pinar, Ekin/E-2322-2017","Pinar, Ekin/0000-0002-8367-1234",,,,,79,0,0,2,6,MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIV,ANKARA,"MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIV, FAC ARCHITECTURE, INONU BULVARI, ANKARA, 06531, TURKEY",0258-5316,,,METU J FAC ARCHIT,METU J.

Thus, the main aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of streetscape parameters on the thermal comfort of citizens using urban streets in a hot summer and in a hot semi-arid climate. For this purpose, Karimkhan-e-Zand Street in Shiraz, Iran, was selected as the case study. The selected street is a historical and popular public space of Shiraz. In the present study, using physical and micro-climatic data analyzed in ENVI-met v4 software, the thermal comfort conditions of Karimkhan-e-Zand in Shiraz on 10 July were simulated during the hottest day of the year. Furthermore, the relationships between physical street parameters and micro-climatic parameters and their effects on the thermal comfort index (PMV) were investigated through running a set of regressions in STATA 14 and analysis of ENVI-met v4 output maps. The results of the present study show that the thermal comfort of the citizens, which is determined by the PMV index values, is in very poor condition in almost all the studied hours, and the air temperature has the greatest effect compared to other micro-climatic parameters on the PMV index. The results of present study also show a significant relationship between the sky view factor and mean radiant temperature, as well as between the surface albedo and relative humidity. Furthermore, the type of vegetation and the aspect ratio of the street affect the level of increase in thermal comfort on the street.</p>","[Sadeghi, Ali Reza] Shiraz Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Fac Art & Architecture, Shiraz 7188637911, Iran; [Bahadori, Yasaman] Auburn Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Dept Polit Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Shiraz University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Sadeghi, AR (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Design, Fac Art & Architecture, Shiraz 7188637911, Iran.",arsadeghi@shirazu.ac.ir; yzb0021@auburn.edu,"Sadeghi, Ali Reza/W-9094-2018","Sadeghi, Ali Reza/0000-0002-0047-7533",,,,,45,3,3,9,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,19,,,,,,10886,10.3390/su131910886,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910886,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WK5SZ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000709787200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been dated by various authors in an interval extended from Achaemenid to Sasanian Persian Empires (sixth century BCE to seventh century AD). Significant weathering has been occurred in various stone blocks used in the construction of this monument. The aim of this research is to study the deterioration process of the stone blocks used in the Temple. It includes chemical and mineralogical analysis of stones, characterization of deterioration patterns and processes, and identification of factors influenced the process. Results have been obtained by on-site and laboratory studies, including optical microscopy, petrography, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy methods. They showed that low-porosity limestone and dolomitic limestone have been used in the construction of the Temple, which have a compact micritic structure with variable size calcite veins (sparite) and clay veins. According to the on-site and laboratory studies, the deterioration patterns are partially similar in majority of the stone blocks and include different types of detachments as well as biological colonisations. The multianalytical results proved that the deterioration process is mainly of physical weathering type, due to structural and chemical characteristics of the limestone as well as climate factors, temperature fluctuations in particular. It turned out that limestone characteristics (including presence of clay veins as well as heterogeneity of calcitic matrix (micrite and sparite)) can affect the behaviour of stone blocks against climate factors; helping us to find reasons behind physical weathering of limestone in the cultural/historical sites and monuments.","[Barnoos, Vahid; Ouddashi, Omid; Shekofteh, Atefeh] Art Univ Isfahan, Dept Conservat Cultural & Hist Properties, Esfahan, Iran",,"Ouddashi, O (corresponding author), Art Univ Isfahan, Dept Conservat Cultural & Hist Properties, Esfahan, Iran.",o.oudbashi@aui.ac.ir,"Shekofteh, Atefeh/ABB-4346-2020; Oudbashi, Omid/P-4708-2018; Oudbashi, Omid/G-2468-2017","Shekofteh, Atefeh/0000-0003-0664-8476; Oudbashi, Omid/0000-0002-7984-8199; ",Art University of Isfahan,Art University of Isfahan,This research was funded by Art University of Isfahan.,,100,4,5,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2050-7445,,,HERIT SCI,Herit.

We note that many of the planning principles, spatial configurations and environmental technologies of tropical architecture could be traced to knowledge and practices from the eighteenth century onwards, and we explore three pre-1950s moments of 'tropical architecture' in the British empire through building types such as the bungalow, military barrack and labourers' housing in the tropics. Unlike the depoliticized technical discourse of tropical architecture in the mid-twentieth century, this earlier history shows that so-called tropical architecture was inextricably entangled with medical and racial discourses, biopolitics and the political economy of colonialism. We argue that tropical architecture should not be understood as an entity with a fixed essence that is overdetermined by a timeless and unchanging external tropical nature. Rather, tropical architecture should be understood as a set of shifting discourses that privilege tropical nature, especially climate, in various ways as the prime determinant of built form according to different constellations of sociocultural and technoscientific conditions. We thus see 'tropical architecture' not as a depoliticized entity but as a power-knowledge configuration inextricably linked to asymmetrical colonial power relations.","[Chang, Jiat-Hwee] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Architecture, Sch Design & Environm, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [King, Anthony D.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Art Hist, Binghamton, NY USA",National University of Singapore; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Chang, JH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Architecture, Sch Design & Environm, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",jiathwee@nus.edu.sg,"Chang, Jiat-Hwee/AAY-2552-2021","Chang, Jiat-Hwee/0000-0001-8611-5068",,,,,52,31,31,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0129-7619,1467-9493,,SINGAPORE J TROP GEO,Singap.

Dramatic tectonic activity in the early Miocene generated two main mountain ranges and led to the retreat of Paratethys. This meant the Balkan Peninsula became a crossroads for many migrating species. Currently, the majority of central European species, along with some Mediterranean, and even EuroSiberian taxa can be found in Serbia. Fossil records from caves reveal changes in fossil fauna from the Pleistocene to Holocene. There is evidence that the distinct configuration of the terrain in the Balkans led to many isolated areas, enabling large mammal species, together with Neanderthals that were living in the area, to find refuge and survive longer than in the rest of Europe. The best fossil associations containing small vertebrates come from the Baranica, Hadzi Prodanova, Pesturina, and Smolucka caves. Based on available numerical dating, an attempt has been made to fit these within the chronological context of the Mousterian-Aurignacian-Gravettian cultural succession. The stratigraphy of the layers corresponds to the so-called MIS 5 to MIS 2 (i.e., from 70,000 to 14,000 years ago). This paper presents a review of the herpetofaunal findings from Serbia, and analyses the data collected. Statistical approaches, involving hierarchical clustering and correspondence analysis, have been used on the fossil amphibian and reptile assemblages. As associated context is often not sufficient, small mammal assemblages have been used as a comparative proxy for reconstructing the palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment, through the application of taxonomical habitat indexes and bioclimate analysis. The overall analysis reveals that the herpetofaunal composition experience substantial change between MIS 3 and MIS 2, when there were a loss of diversity and the concurrence of species adapted to cold climates and environments, in accordance with the glacial cycle.

In this view, the present study investigates the dynamic thermal performance of an innovative cool polyurethane-based membrane with PCMs inclusion for roofing applications. Such membranes were developed in previous works when the new composite material was characterized in terms of thermal-optical and morphological properties, when integrating PCMs with transition point at 25 degrees C and 55 degrees C. In this work, such materials is finally implemented into a roof multilayer structure, and additional experimental tests are carried out in a dedicated environmental simulation chamber, where the thermal performance of the novel lightweight roof stratigraphy is investigated. To this aim, two types of membranes for roofing applications, i.e. the innovative proposed cool membrane and a more traditional dark bitumen membrane, are considered. These two roof configurations are tested with and without the integration of PCMs, with varying the melting temperature range, in two different climate boundary conditions, i.e. Mediterranean climate of Rome, Italy, and Hot desert climate of Abu Dhabi, UAE. Moreover, numerical analysis of the roof thermal behavior is carried out through transient heat transfer calculation. Therefore, the two roof configurations are simulated and compared, in the same selected climate conditions and with varying PCMs. Findings of coupled experimental tests and numerical analysis show that the combination of cool membrane and PCMs with suitable melting temperature range allows to significantly reduce the roof surface temperatures and, therefore, the heat flux through the roof. In detail, results of numerical analysis demonstrate how in Rome the integration of PCMs with melting point around 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C in the cool and the dark roof membrane, respectively, has a great effect in reducing the external roof surface temperature. On the contrary, in Abu Dhabi, the configuration allowing the higher inward heat flux reduction is represented by the integration of PCMs with melting point around 35 degrees C and 55 degrees C in the cool and dark membrane, respectively. On the other hand, experimental tests show how the inclusion of a PCM layer with melting point around 25 degrees C and 31 degrees C under the cool and dark coating membrane, respectively, allows the best thermal performance in both climate conditions. Therefore, this work showed the promising effectiveness of PCMs inclusion to improve the thermal performance of waterproof membranes for roofing applications. However, as demonstrated, the selection of the proper PCM melting temperature should be operated by taking into account not only the climate conditions, but especially the roofing medium and the position in the roof stratigraphy where thermal energy storage materials are integrated. In fact, roof coating thermal behavior is largely influenced by its thermal-optical properties, e.g. solar reflectance and thermal emittance.","[Piselli, Cristina; Castaldo, Veronica Lucia; Pisello, Anna Laura] CIRIAF Interuniv Res Ctr, Via G Duranti 63, I-06125 Perugia, Italy; [Pisello, Anna Laura] Univ Perugia, Dept Engn, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Pisello, AL (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dept Engn, Via G Duranti 67, I-06125 Perugia, Italy.",anna.pisello@unipg.it,"Piselli, Cristina/AGL-4455-2022","Piselli, Cristina/0000-0003-1856-3103",European Union [657466]; CIRIAF program for UNESCO,European Union(European Commission); CIRIAF program for UNESCO,"This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 657466 (INPATH-TES).

The observed zonal mean ITCZ location varies from 5.3 degrees S in the boreal winter to 7.2 degrees N in the boreal summer with an annual mean position of 1.65 degrees N while the AHT(EQ) varies from 2.1 PW northward in the boreal winter to 2.3 PW southward in the boreal summer with an annual mean of 0.1 PW southward. Seasonal variations in the ITCZ location and AHT(EQ) are highly anticorrelated in the observations and in a suite of state-of-the-art coupled climate models with regression coefficients of -2.7 degrees and -2.4 degrees PW-1 respectively. It is also found that seasonal variations in ITCZ location and AHT(EQ) are well correlated in a suite of slab ocean aquaplanet simulations with varying ocean mixed layer depths. However, the regression coefficient between ITCZ location and AHT(EQ) decreases with decreasing mixed layer depth as a consequence of the asymmetry that develops between the winter and summer Hadley cells as the ITCZ moves farther off the equator. The authors go on to analyze the annual mean change in ITCZ location and AHT(EQ) in an ensemble of climate perturbation experiments including the response to CO2 doubling, simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum, and simulations of the mid-Holocene. The shift in the annual average ITCZ location is also strongly anticorrelated with the change in annual mean AHT(EQ) with a regression coefficient of -3.2 degrees PW-1, similar to that found over the seasonal cycle.","[Donohoe, Aaron; Marshall, John; Ferreira, David; Mcgee, David] MIT, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Donohoe, A (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Room 54-918,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",thedhoe@mit.edu,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Ferreira, David/0000-0003-3243-9774",NOAA Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship,NOAA Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship,"AD was supported by the NOAA Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Even after a sensible bias adjustment these errors remain and are inherited to some extent by the derived downscaling products, impairing the credibility of future regional projections. In this study we perform a process-based evaluation of state-of-the-art GCMs from CMIP5 and CMIP6, with a focus on the simulation of the synoptic climatological patterns having a most prominent effect on the European climate. To this aim, we use the Lamb Weather Type Classification (LWT, Lamb British isles weather types and a register of the daily sequence 736 of circulation patterns 1861-1971. METEOROL OFF, GEOPHYS MEM; 737 GB; DA 1972; NO 116; PP 1-85; BIBL 2P1/2, 1972), a subjective classification of circulation weather types constructed upon historical simulations of daily mean sea level pressure. Observational uncertainty has been taken into account by considering four different reanalysis products of varying characteristics. Our evaluation unveils an overall improvement of salient atmospheric circulation features consistent across observational references, although this is uneven across models and large frequency biases still remain for the main LWTs. Some CMIP6 models attain similar or even worse results than their CMIP5 counterparts, although in most cases consistent improvements have been found, demonstrating the ability of the new models to better capture key synoptic conditions. In light of the large differences found across models, we advocate for a careful selection of driving GCMs in downscaling experiments with a special focus on large-scale atmospheric circulation aspects.","[Fernandez-Granja, Juan A.; Casanueva, Ana; Bedia, Joaquin; Fernandez, Jesus] Univ Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Santander 39005, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Fernandez-Granja, JA (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Santander 39005, Spain.",juan.fernandez@unican.es,"Fernández, Jesús/F-5189-2011; Bedia, Joaquin/Q-2148-2015; Casanueva, Ana/L-4055-2015","Fernández, Jesús/0000-0002-3483-0008; Bedia, Joaquin/0000-0001-6219-4312; Casanueva, Ana/0000-0002-7568-0229; Fernandez De La Granja, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-9763-7811","Project INDECIS, part of European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ERA4CS); European Union [690462]; Spanish R&D Program through project INSIGNIA [CGL2016-79210-R]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER)","Project INDECIS, part of European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ERA4CS); European Union(European Commission); Spanish R&D Program through project INSIGNIA; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER)(European Commission)","We acknowledge the World Climate Research Program's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in Table 1) for producing and making available their model output.

Several CO2 capture strategies have been developed, such as absorption, adsorption, membrane, chemical looping, hydrating and biofixation. Among different technologies, particular attention has been given to cryogenic CO2 capture by phase change. The aim of this study is to improve interest in cryogenic technologies for CO2 capture by providing an overview of the actual status of CCS. To reach this goal, the major strategies and technologies for CO2 capture from fossil fuel combustion have been reviewed. Simultaneously, the characteristics of cryogenic technologies for CO2 capture are summarized. The existing challenges that need to be overcome in cryogenic technology include cold energy sources, capture costs and impurities, etc. Finally, opportunities for the future development of cryogenic-based technologies are discussed. The results of this investigation indicated that cryogenic CO2 capture processes can be easily retrofitted to the existing industrial emission facilities and avoid the challenges associated with chemical solvents or physical sorbents.","[Song, Chunfeng; Liu, Qingling] Tianjin Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Indoor Air Environm Qual Control, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Song, Chunfeng; Deng, Shuai] Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Low & Medium Grade Ene, Minist Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Li, Hailong] Malardalen Univ, Sch Sustainable Dev Soc & Technol, SE-72123 Vasteras, Sweden; [Kitamura, Yutaka] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan",Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Malardalen University; University of Tsukuba,"Song, CF (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Indoor Air Environm Qual Control, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",chunfeng.song@tju.edu.cn,"LIU, Qingling/A-9197-2011; Deng, Shuai/P-8645-2017","LIU, Qingling/0000-0002-5058-883X; Deng, Shuai/0000-0002-2365-1944","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21878228, 51506147]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City [17JCQNJC08500]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by Tianjin City [TJSQNTJ-2017-03]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2015ZX07306001-02]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by Tianjin City; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment,"This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21878228 and 51506147), Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City (17JCQNJC08500), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by Tianjin City (TJSQNTJ-2017-03) and Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2015ZX07306001-02).",,133,167,174,97,514,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

However, here we show that a robust ENSO signal in tropical Atlantic precipitation anomalies can be detected throughout ENSO's whole lifecycle. We find that the ENSO impact on the tropical Atlantic precipitation migrates meridionally, following the seasonal migration of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Taking into account the modulation of the local seasonal cycle, the full spatiotemporal characteristics of ENSO's impact on tropical Atlantic precipitation are uncovered. Furthermore, we demonstrate that climate models can simulate the modulation of ENSO-related precipitation over the tropical Atlantic by the local seasonal cycle despite the substantial mean state model bias in the Atlantic ITCZ. This extended perspective on ENSO's impact on tropical Atlantic climate variability enhances prospects for skillful year-round regional climate prediction. Plain Language Summary El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) provides the primary source of predictability for the tropical Atlantic precipitation on interannual time scales. In most previous studies, a strong seasonal preference in the ENSO teleconnection to the Atlantic was identified. We here demonstrate that ENSO's impact on tropical Atlantic precipitation can be detected from ENSO developing to decaying phases, which is strongly modulated by the local seasonal cycle regarding its meridional migration. On this basis, we establish a robust year-round statistical relationship between ENSO and tropical Atlantic precipitation by involving the local seasonal cycle. This observed modulation of the local seasonal cycle on ENSO's impact can also be simulated in the state-of-the-art climate models. It is suggested that the realistic representation of the Atlantic seasonal cycle, as well as the improved ENSO prediction, could directly translate into enhanced prediction skill over the tropical Atlantic sector.","[Jiang, Feng; Zhang, Wenjun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Stuecker, Malte F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Int Pacific Res Ctr IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Zhang, WJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhangwj@nuist.edu.cn,"Stuecker, Malte Fabian/H-6304-2011","Stuecker, Malte Fabian/0000-0001-8355-0662","National Nature Science Foundation of China [42125501, 42088101]; NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program [NA20OAR4310445]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program","This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (42125501 and 42088101).

This generates multiple environmental pressures such as increased demand for water resources, generation of pollution related to wastewater discharge, and land consumption. In the Mediterranean area, recent climate change studies forecast large impacts on the hydrologic cycle. Thus, in the next years, surface and ground-water resources will be gradually more stressed, especially in coastal areas. In this review paper, the historical and geographical distribution of peer-review studies and the main mechanisms that promote aquifer salinization in the Mediterranean area are critically discussed, providing the state of the art on topics such as actual saltwater wedge characterization, paleo-salinities in coastal areas, water-rock interactions, geophysical techniques aimed at delineating the areal and vertical extent of saltwater intrusion, management of groundwater overexploitation using numerical models and GIS mapping techniques for aquifer vulnerability to salinization. Each of the above-mentioned approaches has potential advantages and drawbacks; thus, the best tactic to tackle coastal aquifer management is to employ a combination of approaches. Finally, the number of studies focusing on predictions of climate change effects on coastal aquifers are growing but are still very limited and surely need further research.","[Mastrocicco, Micol] Campania Univ Vanvitelli, Dept Environm Biol & Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, I-81100 Caserta, Italy; [Colombani, Nicolo] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Mat Environm Sci & Urban Planning, I-60131 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Colombani, N (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Mat Environm Sci & Urban Planning, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",micol.mastrocicco@unicampania.it; n.colombani@univpm.it,"colombani, nicolò/J-2336-2015; colombani, nicolo/ABG-6666-2021; mastrocicco, micol/J-2291-2015","colombani, nicolò/0000-0002-6593-8505; colombani, nicolo/0000-0002-6593-8505; mastrocicco, micol/0000-0003-3251-9117",,,,,238,19,20,6,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,1,,,,,,90,10.3390/w13010090,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13010090,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PQ3AG,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000606419600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experimental protocols for simulations of the mid-Holocene (midHolocene, 6000 years before present) and the Last Interglacial (lig127k, 127 000 years before present) are described here. These equilibrium simulations are designed to examine the impact of changes in orbital forcing at times when atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were similar to those of the preindustrial period and the continental configurations were almost identical to modern ones. These simulations test our understanding of the interplay between radiative forcing and atmospheric circulation, and the connections among large-scale and regional climate changes giving rise to phenomena such as land-sea contrast and high-latitude amplification in temperature changes, and responses of the monsoons, as compared to today. They also provide an opportunity, through carefully designed additional sensitivity experiments, to quantify the strength of atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land-surface feedbacks. Sensitivity experiments are proposed to investigate the role of freshwater forcing in triggering abrupt climate changes within interglacial epochs. These feedback experiments naturally lead to a focus on climate evolution during interglacial periods, which will be examined through transient experiments. Analyses of the sensitivity simulations will also focus on interactions between extratropical and tropical circulation, and the relationship between changes in mean climate state and climate variability on annual to multi-decadal timescales. The comparative abundance of paleoenvironmental data and of quantitative climate reconstructions for the Holocene and Last Interglacial make these two epochs ideal candidates for systematic evaluation of model performance, and such comparisons will shed new light on the importance of external feedbacks (e.g., vegetation, dust) and the ability of state-of-the-art models to simulate climate changes realistically.","[Otto-Bliesner, Bette L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, 1850 Table Mesa Dr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Braconnot, Pascale; Govin, Aline; Peterschmitt, Jean-Yves] Univ Paris Saclay, LSCE IPSL, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, Ctr Climate Change, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, SAGES, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Lunt, Daniel J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 277208564, Japan; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Albani, Samuel] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany; [Bartlein, Patrick J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Capron, Emilie] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Ctr Ice & Climate, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Capron, Emilie] British Antarctic Survey, High Cross Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Carlson, Anders E.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dutton, Andrea] Univ Florida, Dept Geol Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Fischer, Hubertus; Joos, Fortunat; Nehrbass-Ahles, Christoph] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Phys Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischer, Hubertus; Joos, Fortunat; Nehrbass-Ahles, Christoph] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Goelzer, Heiko] Univ Utrecht, Inst Marine & Atmospher Res Utrecht IMAU, Princetonplein 5, NL-3584 CC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Goelzer, Heiko] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Glaciol, CP160-03,Av F Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Haywood, Alan] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [LeGrande, Allegra N.] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Lipscomb, William H.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Group T 3, Fluid Dynam & Solid Mech, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Lohmann, Gerrit] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Mahowald, Natalie] Cornell Univ, Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Pausata, Francesco S.

Wet regions are those where atmospheric demand is less than precipitation (energy limited), and dry regions are those where atmospheric demand is greater than precipitation (water limited). Long-term streamflow trends in western North America and an analysis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models at global scales show geographically heterogeneous detectability of hydrological changes. We apply the Budyko framework and state-of-the-art climate model data from CMIP5 to quantify the sensitivity and detectability of terrestrial hydrological changes. The Budyko framework quantifies the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff components. We find that the terrestrial hydrological sensitivity is 3 times greater in regions where the hydrological cycle is energy limited rather than water limited. This additional source (the terrestrial part) contributes to 30-40% greater detectability in energy-limited regions. We also quantified the contribution of changes in the catchment efficiency parameter that oppose the effects of increasing evaporative demand in global warming scenarios. Incorporating changes to the catchment efficiency parameter in the Budyko framework reduces dry biases in global runoff change projections by 88% in the 21st century.","[Kumar, Sanjiv; Zwiers, Francis; Shrestha, Rajesh; Werner, Arelia T.] Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Kumar, Sanjiv] NOAA, ESRL Phys Sci Div, Boulder, CO USA; [Dirmeyer, Paul A.] George Mason Univ, Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Lawrence, David M.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",University of Victoria; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Center for Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies; George Mason University; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC, Canada.;Kumar, S (corresponding author), NOAA, ESRL Phys Sci Div, Boulder, CO USA.",Sanjiv.Kumar@noaa.gov,"Dirmeyer, Paul/P-3275-2019; Lawrence, David M/C-4026-2011; Werner, Augusto Trujillo/AAE-6978-2019; Shrestha, Rajesh/ABE-1459-2021","Dirmeyer, Paul/0000-0003-3158-1752; Lawrence, David M/0000-0002-2968-3023; Shrestha, Rajesh/0000-0001-7781-6495",NSERC Canadian Sea Ice and snow Evaluation (CanSISE) Network,NSERC Canadian Sea Ice and snow Evaluation (CanSISE) Network,"S.K. and F.Z. were supported by NSERC Canadian Sea Ice and snow Evaluation (CanSISE) Network.

Extreme Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events occurred repeatedly in recent decades with an unprecedented series of three consecutive episodes during 2006-08, causing vast climate and socioeconomic effects worldwide and weakening the historic El Nino-Indian monsoon relationship. Major attention has been paid to the El Nino influence on the Indian Ocean, but how the IOD influences El Nino and its predictability remained an important issue to be understood. On the basis of various forecast experiments activating and suppressing air-sea coupling in the individual tropical ocean basins using a state-of-the-art coupled ocean atmosphere model with demonstrated predictive capability, the present study shows that the extreme IOD plays a key role in driving the 1994 pseudo-El Nino, in contrast with traditional El Nino theory. The pseudo El Nino is more frequently observed in recent decades, coincident with a weakened atmospheric Walker circulation in response to anthropogenic forcing. The study's results suggest that extreme IOD may significantly enhance El Nino and its onset forecast, which has being a long-standing challenge, and El Nino in turn enhances IOD and its long-range predictability. The intrinsic El Nino-IOD interaction found here provides hope for enhanced prediction skill of both of these climate modes, and it sheds new light on the tropical climate variations and their changes under the influence of global warming.","[Luo, Jing-Jia] JAMSTEC, Res Inst Global Change, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Masumoto, Yukio; Yamagata, Toshio] Univ Tokyo, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lukas, Roger] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Tokyo; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Luo, JJ (corresponding author), JAMSTEC, Res Inst Global Change, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",luo@jamstec.go.jp,"Behera, Swadhin/B-7839-2009; Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019; MASUMOTO, YUKIO/G-5021-2014; Luo, Jing-Jia/B-2481-2008; Yamagata, Toshio/A-1807-2009","Behera, Swadhin/0000-0001-8692-2388; Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; ",,,,,68,221,230,6,55,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

The drying rate mechanisms with which walls redistribute and transport moisture away from the envelope may affect the service life of the wall system. Potential moisture-induced damage becomes important when the wall is not properly designed with adequate drying capacity. This paper investigates the drying performance of a particular EIFS (exterior insulation and finish system) clad wall. A state-of-the-art two-dimensional hygrothermal model, developed by the authors, was employed to determine the hourly spatial temperatures, moisture content, and air velocity distributions within wall systems as a function of real climatic conditions. In the parametric investigation, the performance of a particular EIFS clad wall as a junction of two stud cavity insulation materials was studied. Two cavity insulation materials were investigated:fiberglass and cellulose insulation. Two climatic conditions were chosen in the moisture analysis, representing cold and mild climates; these were Chicago, Illinois, and Wilmington, North Carolina, respectively. The effect of wall drying and wetting in the presence of a particular airflow path (cracks) was investigated for all cases. The air leakage path was assumed to be present due to an electrical outlet close at the interior an opening present between oriented strand panels, and a conduit in the stucco layer Initial OSB moisture content was assumed to be very high. The influences of wind-driven rain, solar radiation, and air movement were included in the simulation analysis on an hourly basis. Results showed that air leakage through a particular EIFS clad wall in Wilmington produced a net drying effect for a wall system with an initially wet OSB layer while air leakage developed a net seasonal moisture accumulation in Chicago. The effect of stud cavity insulation was found to be critical, as the storage capacity for moisture increased in the cellulose case, compared to the fiberglass insulation case. The distinct effect is present when comparing the two insulation systems. The cellulose insulation case retained higher amounts of moisture. Solar-driven moisture was also more critical in the cellulose insulation case than in the fiberglass case. The thermal and moisture results were then linked to a state-of-the-art mold growth model to assess the risk of moisture-induced damage. Results were developed in the form of mold growth indexes. Results showed the probable mold growth index potential as a junction of climatic conditions and as a function of cavity insulation. Higher risk of mold growth is present in the cellulose case than in the fiberglass insulation case. If there is a high mold growth index and the underlying material is maintained at high moisture content, there is a potential for developing decay (if the wood is already infected internally). Since boric acid is added in cellulose insulation as a treatment for fire, mold, and insect and rodent control, as wet blown cellulose comes in contact with other materials, some of the chemical will treat these surfaces. For the same wall system, Wilmington exhibited slightly worse conditions than Chicago for mold growth.

They can have negative implications for societies, including water security and agriculture. For example, changes in their duration and within-year timing can pose a threat to food production and wildfire risk. Conversely, wet spells are sequences of days with precipitation above a certain threshold, and changes in their duration and within-year timing can impact agriculture, flooding or the prevalence of water-related vector-borne diseases. Here we assess changes in the duration and within-year timing of extreme dry and wet spells over 60 years (1958-2017) using a consistent global land surface precipitation dataset of 5093 rain gauge locations. The dataset allowed for detailed spatial analyses of the United States, Europe and Australia. While many locations exhibit statistically significant changes in the duration of extreme dry and wet spells, the changes in the within-year timing are less often significant. Our results show consistencies with observations and projections from state-of-the-art climate and water resources research. In addition, we provide new insights regarding trends in the timing of extreme dry and wet spells, an aspect being equally important for possible future implications of extremes in a changing climate, which has not yet received the same level of attention and is characterized by larger uncertainty.","[Breinl, Korbinian; Lun, David] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Karlspl 13-222, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Breinl, Korbinian; Di Baldassarre, Giuliano; Mazzoleni, Maurizio] CNDS, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, Villavagen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Di Baldassarre, Giuliano; Mazzoleni, Maurizio] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Villavagen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Vico, Giulia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Ulls Vag 16, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Technische Universitat Wien; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Uppsala University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Breinl, K (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Karlspl 13-222, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.;Breinl, K (corresponding author), CNDS, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, Villavagen 16, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",breinl@hydro.tuwien.ac.at,"Mazzoleni, Maurizio/O-2566-2016; Mazzoleni, Maurizio/F-5362-2018; Di Baldassarre, Giuliano/C-7304-2009; Vico, Giulia/A-6296-2010","Mazzoleni, Maurizio/0000-0002-0913-9370; Mazzoleni, Maurizio/0000-0002-0913-9370; Di Baldassarre, Giuliano/0000-0002-8180-4996; Vico, Giulia/0000-0002-7849-2653; Breinl, Korbinian/0000-0003-0489-4526","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [793558]; European Research Council (ERC), 'HydroSocialExtremes: Uncovering the Mutual Shaping of Hydrological Extremes and Society' [771678]; DFG project SPATE [FOR 2416]; FWF project SPATE [I 3174]; FWF Vienna Doctoral Program on Water Resource Systems [DK W1219-N28]; Swedish Research Council Vetenskapsradet [2016-04910]; Swedish Research Council FORMAS [2018-02872]; ERA-NET Cofund WaterWorks2014 Call","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(SKA South Africa); European Research Council (ERC), 'HydroSocialExtremes: Uncovering the Mutual Shaping of Hydrological Extremes and Society'; DFG project SPATE; FWF project SPATE; FWF Vienna Doctoral Program on Water Resource Systems; Swedish Research Council Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); ERA-NET Cofund WaterWorks2014 Call","KB gratefully received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement STARFLOOD No. 793558 (www.starflood.at).GDB acknowledges the funding from the European Research Council (ERC), 'HydroSocialExtremes: Uncovering the Mutual Shaping of Hydrological Extremes and Society', Consolidator Grant No. 771678.

Comprehensive climate models have struggled to reproduce this trend, typically simulating a slower rate of sea ice retreat than has been observed. However, this bias has been widely noted to have decreased in models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) compared with the previous generation of models (CMIP3). Here simulations are examined from both CMIP3 and CMIP5. It is found that simulated historical sea ice trends are influenced by volcanic forcing, which was included in all of the CMIP5 models but in only about half of the CMIP3 models. The volcanic forcing causes temporary simulated cooling in the 1980s and 1990s, which contributes to raising the simulated 1979-2013 global-mean surface temperature trends to values substantially larger than observed. It is shown that this warming bias is accompanied by an enhanced rate of Arctic sea ice retreat and hence a simulated sea ice trend that is closer to the observed value, which is consistent with previous findings of an approximately linear relationship between sea ice extent and global-mean surface temperature. Both generations of climate models are found to simulate Arctic sea ice that is substantially less sensitive to global warming than has been observed. The results imply that much of the difference in Arctic sea ice trends between CMIP3 and CMIP5 occurred because of the inclusion of volcanic forcing, rather than improved sea ice physics or model resolution.","[Rosenblum, Erica; Eisenman, Ian] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Rosenblum, E (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ejrosenb@ucsd.edu,"Eisenman, Ian/B-9329-2009",,"National Science Foundation [ARC-1107795, OCE-1357078]; Directorate For Geosciences [1357078] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"Without implying their endorsement, we are grateful to Sarah Gille, Art Miller, Paul Kushner, Neil Tandon, Frederic Laliberte, Till Wagner, and John Fyfe for helpful comments and discussions.

Progress is likely to be rapid if model developers identify the potential users of their models and the needs of those users. Users include operational forest managers, planners, bureaucrats, politicians, community and environmental groups, scientists, and academics. Extant models that could be used immediately or could be adapted for use by these groups are reviewed. Currently available process-based models can provide good estimates of growth and biomass productivity at various scales; combined with conventional models they can provide information of the type required by managers and planners. Climate-driven models can provide good estimates of potential plantation productivity, while detailed process models contribute to our understanding of the way systems function and are essential for future progress. Technical challenges for the future include continued research on carbon-allocation processes, nutrient availability in soils, and nutrient uptake by trees. It is important that we have models that can be used to predict and analyze the effects of technologies such as clonal forestry and possible genetic manipulation, as well as intensive management in relation to nutrition, weed control, and disease control. Large-scale analysis of forest productivity is already possible using models driven by remote sensing; inclusion of nutrition should be a goal in this area. Moves towards active collaboration and the implementation of mixed models in operational systems, as well as improving communication between model developers and users, should ensure that practical problems are identified and fed back to modellers, which should lead to rapid progress.","Withycombe, Mt Wilson, NSW 2786, Australia",,"Landsberg, J (corresponding author), Withycombe, Church Lane, Mt Wilson, NSW 2786, Australia.",jlandsberg@netspeed.com.au,,,,,,,72,164,171,0,60,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Here, we present a novel model-based approach, where we force a model describing the processes and modifications of delta O-18 from rain water to speleothem calcite (Oxygen isotope Drip water and Stalagmite Model - ODSM) with the results of a state-of-the-art atmospheric general circulation model enhanced by explicit isotope diagnostics (ECHAM5-wiso). The approach is neither climate nor cave-specific and allows an integrated assessment of the influence of different varying climate variables, e. g. temperature and precipitation amount, on the isotopic composition of drip water and speleothem calcite. First, we apply and evaluate this new approach under present-day climate conditions using observational data from seven caves from different geographical regions in Europe. Each of these caves provides measured delta O-18 values of drip water and speleothem calcite to which we compare our simulated isotope values. For six of the seven caves modeled delta O-18 values of drip water and speleothem calcite are in good agreement with observed values. The mismatch of the remaining caves might be caused by the complexity of the cave system, beyond the parameterizations included in our cave model. We then examine the response of the cave system to mid-Holocene (6000 yr before present, 6 ka) climate conditions by forcing the ODSM with ECHAM5-wiso results from 6 ka simulations. For a set of twelve European caves, we compare the modeled mid-Holocene-to-modern difference in speleothem calcite delta O-18 to available measurements. We show that the general European changes are simulated well. However, local discrepancies are found, and might be explained either by a too low model resolution, complex local soil-atmosphere interactions affecting evapotranspiration or by cave specific factors such as non-equilibrium fractionation processes. The mid-Holocene experiment pronounces the potential of the presented approach to analyse delta O-18 variations on a spatially large (regional to global) scale. Modelled as well as measured European delta O-18 values of stalagmite samples suggest the presence of a strong, positive mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation at 6 ka before present, which is supported by the respective modelled climate parameters.","[Wackerbarth, A.; Mangini, A.] Heidelberg Acad Sci, Heidelberg, Germany; [Langebroek, P.

To this end, 21 professionals from different disciplines were selected through a purposive sampling procedure and were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The analysis procedure resulted in the identification of 3 themes, 15 categories, 40 subcategories, and 235 codes. The themes were social, economic, and organizational; The identified categories were culture and education (since culture is something to be learned through formal and informal education this component has two features: culture and education), participation, trust, attitude, solidarity, resources, empowerment, flexibility, credit, supervision, intercommunication, rules, specialization, and research. Validation of the indicators and their usability based on the opinions of local experts was used to calibrate the assessment tool and ensure its context-sensitivity. The results of this research can help planners and policymakers to increase their awareness of flood resilience.

Air-sea fluxes were computed from 6-hourly reanalyzed individual variables using state-of-the-art bulk formulas. Individual variables and computed fluxes were subsampled to simulate VOS-like sampling density. Random simulation of the number of VOS observations and simulation of the number of observations with contemporaneous sampling allowed for estimation of random and total sampling uncertainties respectively. Although reanalyses are dependent on VOS, constituting an important part of data assimilation input, it is assumed that the reanalysis fields adequately reproduce synoptic variability at the sea surface. Sampling errors were quantified by comparison of the regularly sampled (i.e., 6 hourly) and subsampled monthly fields of surface variables and fluxes. In poorly sampled regions random sampling errors amount to 2.5 degrees-3 degrees C for air temperature, 3 ms(-1) for the wind speed, 2-2.5 g kg(-1) for specific humidity, and 15%-20% of the total cloud cover. The highest random sampling errors in surface fluxes were found for the sensible and latent heat flux and range from 30 to 80 W m(-2). Total sampling errors in poorly sampled areas may be higher than random ones by 60%. In poorly sampled subpolar latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and throughout much of the Southern Ocean the total sampling uncertainty in the net heat flux can amount to 80-100 W m(-2). The highest values of the uncertainties associated with the interpolation/extrapolation into unsampled grid boxes are found in subpolar latitudes of both hemispheres for the turbulent fluxes, where they can be comparable with the sampling errors. Simple dependencies of the sampling errors on the number of samples and the magnitude of synoptic variability were derived. Sampling errors estimated from different reanalyses and from seasonal forecasts yield qualitatively comparable spatial patterns, in which the actual values of uncertainties are controlled by the magnitudes of synoptic variability. Finally, estimates of sampling uncertainties are compared with the other errors in air-sea fluxes and the reliability of the estimates obtained is discussed.","PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, RAS, Moscow 117851, Russia; IFM GEOMAR, Kiel, Germany; ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England",Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Gulev, S (corresponding author), PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, RAS, 36 Nakhimovsky Ave, Moscow 117851, Russia.",gul@sail.msk.ru,"Gulev, Sergey/A-4994-2014; Jung, Thomas/J-5239-2012","Jung, Thomas/0000-0002-2651-1293",,,,,84,54,56,0,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

The last 1500 years saw significant changes in the archaeological record in this part of the Australian and zone, with shifts in settlement pattern, site histories, resource use, tool inventories and rock art. Much of the evidence points to regional population growth, beginning 1500-1000 cal. BP and coinciding with expansion of summer-rainfall grassland and more frequent palaeoflood events. Hunter-gatherer groups appear to have increased their use of marginal or outlying areas as these became seasonally accessible. Responses to the demographic changes, especially in the better-watered ranges, include more extended occupation of existing sites, more processing of acacia and grass seeds, and an increase in territoriality reflected in the greater differentiation of rock art complexes after 1500 cal. BP. The archaeological changes are not scaled commensurately with the modest environmental shifts at this time, indicating that human-environment interactions were not linear. A human-environment threshold may have been breached 1500-1000 years ago, with existing socio-economic or historical factors acting to amplify the effects of small environmental changes. However, it remains difficult to fully characterize the nature of these human-environment interactions, despite the fine-grained archaeological record now available. An unresolved problem for this emerging picture of climatic amelioration and population growth is that Aboriginal settlement in Central Australia was expanding at a time when ENSO-driven variability appears to have been at its highest.","[Smith, M.

Papers were classified by ToS in roots (high input degree; n = 9), trunks (high intermediation degree; n = 10) and leaves (high output degree; n = 56). Water research was the most relevant journal, with seven articles published (9.2%), which help to Elsevier to be the most relevant publisher in this topic (n = 28; 36.8%). Timothy J. Wade, Alfred P. Dufour and Helena M. Solo-Gabriele were the most relevant authors, with articles in trunks and leaves and participation in five of papers. Analysis of author affiliations shows the United States (n = 213; 52%) in the lead, followed by United Kingdom (n = 45; 11%) and Greece (n = 26; 6%). A general overview identifies a growing ToS in beach risk assessment, with some very strong references in leaves, and several others of less importance. Finally, analysis from branches suggests research focused around three subtopics (coastal risk assessment, environmental variable associations and Health Risk, Species risk, Water quality and infectious disease), which soon might be a new ToS in the deep forest of the beach management theme.","[Cervantes, Omar] Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Manzanillo, Mexico; [Botero, Camilo M.] Univ Sergio Arboleda, Sch Law, Santa Marta, Colombia; [Finkl, Charles W.] Coastal Educ & Res Fdn CERF, Fletcher, NC USA; [Finkl, Charles W.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Geosci, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",Universidad de Colima; University Sergio Arboleda; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Cervantes, O (corresponding author), Univ Colima, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Manzanillo, Mexico.",omar_cervantes@ucol.mx; playascol@gmail.com,"Cervantes, Omar/AAA-3328-2020; Cervantes, Omar/AAF-4747-2020; Botero, Camilo/ABC-5309-2021","Cervantes, Omar/0000-0002-7559-3889; Botero, Camilo/0000-0001-6886-8920",,,,,77,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2211-0577,2211-0585,978-3-319-58304-4; 978-3-319-58303-7,COAST RES LIBR,,,2018,,,,,333,348,,10.1007/978-3-319-58304-4_17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-58304-4_17,10.1007/978-3-319-58304-4,,16,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,BL2HK,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000448964600019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, food production globally has to increase by 70% in order to feed the world, while total arable land, which has reached its maximal utilization, may even decrease. Moreover, climate change adds yet another challenge to global food security. In order to feed the world in 2050, biotechnological advances in modern agriculture are essential. Plant genetic engineering, which has created a new wave of global crop production after the first green revolution, will continue to play an important role in modern agriculture to meet these challenges. Plastid genetic engineering, with several unique advantages including transgene containment, has made significant progress in the last two decades in various biotechnology applications including development of crops with high levels of resistance to insects, bacterial, fungal and viral diseases, different types of herbicides, drought, salt and cold tolerance, cytoplasmic male sterility, metabolic engineering, phytoremediation of toxic metals and production of many vaccine antigens, biopharmaceuticals and biofuels. However, useful traits should be engineered via chloroplast genomes of several major crops. This review provides insight into the current state of the art of plastid engineering in relation to agricultural production, especially for engineering agronomic traits. Understanding the bottleneck of this technology and challenges for improvement of major crops in a changing climate are discussed.","[Clarke, Jihong Liu] Bioforsk Norwegian Inst Agr & Environm Res, Plant Hlth & Protect Div, N-1432 As, Norway; [Daniell, Henry] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Mol Biol & Microbiol, Coll Med, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Bioforsk; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Clarke, JL (corresponding author), Bioforsk Norwegian Inst Agr & Environm Res, Plant Hlth & Protect Div, Hoegskoleveien 7, N-1432 As, Norway.",jihong.liu-clarke@bioforsk.no; daniell@mail.ucf.edu,"Clarke, Jihong Liu/J-1278-2014; Daniell, Henry/L-3655-2019","Daniell, Henry/0000-0003-4485-1176",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM063879] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIGMS NIH HHS [R01 GM063879] Funding Source: Medline,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIGMS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),,,88,56,61,2,77,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4412,1573-5028,,PLANT MOL BIOL,Plant Mol.Biol.,JUL,2011,5-Mar,,SI,,211,220,,10.1007/s11103-011-9767-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-011-9767-z,,,10,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences,771PC,21437683,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000291172200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

These biases contribute to discrepancies in simulating other characteristics of TC activities (e.g., track, intensity, and duration) and even the surrounding large-scale circulation. The genesis potential index (GPI) is a useful tool to evaluate the performance of climate models in simulating TC genesis. Here, it is employed to investigate possible causes of simulation biases of TC genesis location in western North Pacific using the downscaled Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 (CAM5) climate model and observations. We find that GPI can reasonably describe the spatial pattern of TC genesis location in either observation or simulation. By having one of GPI-related variables (i.e., low-level absolute vorticity, middle-level relative humidity, vertical wind shear, and potential intensity) change with the others set to stable while testing single variable, the contributions of environmental fields associated with GPI are examined and a possible cause of TC genesis biases is revealed. Due to the overestimated humidity in the east region of western North Pacific, the simulated GPI high value region is to the east of the observed one, and more TCs in the downscaled CAM5 model generate farther east than in observation. These results imply that the biases in simulated humidity and thus TC genesis location may be reduced by correcting the evaporation rate in the deep convection scheme, since the evaporation rate is closely related to environment humidity change as suggested by previous studies.","[Shen, Yixuan; Sun, Yuan; Zhong, Zhong; Hu, Yijia] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yuan; Li, Tim] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Zhong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, IPRC, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Tim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Yi, Lan] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Chinese Meteorol Soc, Beijing, Peoples R China",National University of Defense Technology - China; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS),"Sun, Y (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Sun, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",sunyuan1214@126.com,"Sun, Yuan/K-3261-2015","Sun, Yuan/0000-0002-1918-6752","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1505803]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41430426, 41605072, 41675077]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change,"This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1505803), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41430426, 41605072, 41675077) and Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Climate Change.

It has been proposed that, across broad spatial scales, climatic factors are the main drivers of ecological patterns, while biotic factors are mainly important at local spatial scales. However, few tests of the effect of biotic interactions on broad-scale patterns have been conducted; conclusions about the scale-dependence of the importance of biotic interactions thus seem premature. 2. We developed an extensive database of locality records of one of Africas most conspicuous groups, the acacias (the genera Senegalia and Vachellia), and used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the distribution of all African acacias. 3. African acacias are particularly well adapted against mammalian herbivory; therefore, we hypothesized that browser diversity could be an important driver of acacia richness. Species richness maps for the two genera were created from SDM-generated maps. Ordinary least square (OLS) regressions and, to consider spatial autocorrelation, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) analyses were used to model richness of the two genera in relation to mammalian browser richness, current environment (including climate), and climate history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We used variation partitioning to determine what percentage of variation could be explained by these three groups of factors. 4. Both genera showed centres of richness in East Africa and the Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. Browser richness was the best explanatory variable for richness of both genera. Environmental factors explained negligible variation in the richness of Senegalia, but some variation in Vachellia. For both genera, the residuals of the species richness model of one genus also explained much variation in the richness of the other genus, indicating that common factors not considered in the richness analyses here may additionally be driving the richness of both genera. 5. Mechanisms that could generate a correlation between browser and acacia richness are proposed, and differences in the determinants of richness patterns of Senegalia and Vachellia discussed in the light of the two generas history of colonization of Africa. 6. Synthesis. This is the first study that demonstrates that consumer diversity can influence richness patterns at continental scales and demonstrates that biotic factors can drive richness even at broad spatial scales.","[Greve, Michelle; Sandel, Brody S.; Sandom, Christopher; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Lykke, Anne M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Fagg, Christopher W.] Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Herbario UB & Fac Ceilandia, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Bogaert, Jan] Univ Liege, Unite Biodiversite & Paysage, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Friis, Ib] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, DK-1123 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Marchant, Rob; Marshall, Andrew R.] Univ York, York Inst Trop Ecosyst Dynam, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Marchant, Rob; Marshall, Andrew R.] Univ York, Dept Environm, Ctr Integrat Res Conservat & Learning CIRCLE, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Marshall, Andrew R.] Flamingo Land Ltd, Kirby Misperton YO17 6UX, N Yorkshire, England; [Ndayishimiye, Joel] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Serv Ecol Paysage & Syst Prod Vegetable, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Sandel, Brody S.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Mass Data Algorithm MADALGO, DK-8000 Aarhus N, Denmark; [Schmidt, Marco; Zizka, Georg] Goethe Univ, Inst Ecol Evolut & Div, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmidt, Marco; Zizka, Georg] Res Inst Senckenberg, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmidt, Marco; Zizka, Georg] Res Inst Senckenberg, Dept Bot & Mol Evolut, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Timberlake, Jonathan R.] Royal Bot Gardens, Herbarium, Richmond TW9 3AB, Surrey, England; [Wieringa, Jan J.] Wageningen Univ, Biosystemat Grp, Herbarium Vadense, Netherlands Ctr Biodivers Naturalis,Sect NHN, NL-6703 BL Wageningen, Netherlands","Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Universidade de Brasilia; University of Liege; University of Copenhagen; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Aarhus University; Goethe University Frankfurt; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Wageningen University & Research","Greve, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers Grp, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",michelle_greve@yahoo.com,"Friis, Ib/A-4779-2013; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Schmidt, Marco/C-3821-2009; Lykke, Anne Mette/N-7051-2019; Fagg, Christopher W/G-3599-2016; Sandel, Brody/I-8009-2013; Wieringa, Jan J./D-9517-2015","Friis, Ib/0000-0002-2438-1528; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Schmidt, Marco/0000-0001-6087-6117; Lykke, Anne Mette/0000-0002-4337-8607; Fagg, Christopher W/0000-0001-6072-7832; Wieringa, Jan J./0000-0003-0566-372X; Marchant, Robert/0000-0001-5013-4056; Sandom, Christopher/0000-0003-2294-1648","Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences [272-07-0242]; Undesert Project, EU-FP7 [243906]; Liz Claiborne Art Ortenburg Foundation; African Conservation Centre, Nairobi; BRIC of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Belgian Technical Cooperation","Danish Council for Independent Research - Natural Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Undesert Project, EU-FP7; Liz Claiborne Art Ortenburg Foundation; African Conservation Centre, Nairobi; BRIC of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Belgian Technical Cooperation","Special thanks to Denis Filer who provided assistance with databasing the herbarium records in the BRAHMS database management system for botanical data.

ZAMIACEAE; SPECIES TREE INFERENCE; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; DIOON ZAMIACEAE; LIFE-HISTORY; CYCAD; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; NUCLEAR; POPULATION,"PREMISE Of THE STUDY: Recent estimates of crown ages for cycad genera (Late Miocene) challenge us to consider what processes have produced the extant diversity of this ancient group in such relatively little time. Pleistocene climate change has driven major shifts in species distributions in Mexico and may have led to speciation in the genus Dioon by forcing populations to migrate up in elevation, thereby becoming separated by topography. METHODS: We inferred orthologs from transcriptomes of five species and sequenced these in 42 individuals representing all Dioon species. From these data and published plastid sequences, we inferred dated species trees and lineage-specific diversification rates. KEY RESULTS: Analyses of 84 newly sequenced nuclear orthologs and published plastid data confirm four major clades within Dioon, all of Pleistocene age. Gene tree analysis, divergence dates, and an increase in diversification rate support very recent and rapid divergence of extant taxa. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the Pleistocene age of Dioon species and implicates Pleistocene climate change and established topography in lineage spitting. These results add to our understanding of the cycads as evolutionarily dynamic lineages, not relicts or evolutionary dead ends. We also find that well-supported secondary calibration points can be reliable in the absence of fossils. Our hypothesis of lineage splitting mediated by habitat shifts may be applicable to other taxa that are restricted to elevation specific ecotones.","[Dorsey, Brian L.] Huntington Lib, Art Collect, San Marino, CA 91108 USA; [Dorsey, Brian L.] Huntington Lib, Bot Gardens, San Marino, CA 91108 USA; [Gregory, Timothy J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Bot Garden, 200 Centennial Dr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sass, Chodon] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 431 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sass, Chodon] Univ Calif Berkeley, 431 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sass, Chodon] Univ Calif Berkeley, Jepson Herbaria, 431 Koshland Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Specht, Chelsea D.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Sect Plant Biol, 412 Mann Lib Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Cornell University,"Dorsey, BL (corresponding author), Huntington Lib, Art Collect, San Marino, CA 91108 USA.;Dorsey, BL (corresponding author), Huntington Lib, Bot Gardens, San Marino, CA 91108 USA.",bdorsey@huntington.org,,,"NIH S10 Instrumentation Grants [S10RR029668, S10RR027303]; NIH COBRE grant [P30GM103324]; Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES [S10RR027303, S10RR029668] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [P30GM103324] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","NIH S10 Instrumentation Grants; NIH COBRE grant; Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","The authors thank Roxana Yockteng and Lydia Smith for considerable help with lab work, the UC Evolutionary Genetics Lab (EGL) of the MVZ for generous access to lab space and equipment, Jeff Chemnick and Silvia Salas-Morales for supplying leaf samples, and Dan New and Alida Gerritsen at the University of Idaho for advice and assistance with the Fluidigm Access Array system.

However, In Iran, a country with an ancient civilization, ideas based on thoughtful interaction with nature had existed before the emergence of modernism. One of the effects of this interaction is the construction of buildings suitable for local climates without using fossil fuels for cooling and heating. This would result in environmental protection. Coping with the climate in the hot and dry desert regions of Iran has long been one of the most important concerns of Iranian architects. Iranian houses are one of the most durable Iranian buildings. Describing the architecture of the house has a wonderful meaning for everyone and they are aware of its important role in life. Since a significant amount of time in a human's life is spent at home, thus energy consumption in this area is very thought-provoking. This survey aims to investigate the old houses of Kashan city from a climatic perspective and energy consumption. The study examines each space and compares the min terms of passive energy factors to identify climate-friendly designs and to save energy consumption in Kashan homes. In this survey, Kashan city was selected as a sample of a location with a hot and dry climate. The physical features of houses in this city were examined to understand how they deal with climatic conditions. The data associated with the characteristics of twenty historical houses were collected through field surveys and library and documentary studies. The descriptive and analytical method was examined after creating a questionnaire to achieve passive energy solution factors in selected samples. This article first describes and introduces the different features of each house in Kashan, such as courtyard, porch, types of chambers, basement, etc. Then an adaptation between these places and passive energy is done. In the next step, each of the components of passive energy is defined so that it can be used in contemporary architecture to optimize energy consumption. Like traditional architecture in this climate, houses can be designed by the climate with the current climate technology.","[Yaran, Ali] Minist Sci Res & Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Jafari, Parastoo] Univ Sci & Culture, Fac Art & Architecture, Architecture, Tehran, Iran",,"Yaran, A (corresponding author), Minist Sci Res & Technol, Tehran, Iran.",yaran400@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,2,2,NAZAR RESEARCH CENTER ART ARCHITECTURE & URBANISM,TEHRAN,"NO 23, DR QARIB ST AZADI AVE, TEHRAN, 14198-43311, IRAN",2008-7446,2008-2169,,MANZAR,Manzar,,2022,59,,,,38,53,,10.22034/MANZAR.2022.304882.2150,http://dx.doi.org/10.22034/MANZAR.2022.304882.2150,,,16,Architecture,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Architecture,3Q4VE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000838230000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the way in which temperate forests regulate the regional temperature and water cycling remains unclear. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the role that temperate forests play in the regulation of the regional temperature and precipitation by combining remote sensing observations with a state-of-the-art regional climate model. Our results indicated that the forest ecosystem could slightly warm the annual air temperature by 0.04 +/- 0.02 degrees C and bring more rainfall (17.49 +/- 3.88 mm) over Northeast China. The temperature and precipitation modification function of forests varies across the seasons. If the trees were not there, our model suggests that the temperature across Northeast China would become much colder in the winter and spring, and much hotter in the summer than the observed climate. Interestingly, the temperature regulation from the forest ecosystem was detected in both forested regions and the adjacent agricultural areas, suggesting that the temperate forests in Northeast China cushion the air temperature by increasing the temperature in the winter and spring, and decreasing the temperature in the summer over the whole region. Our study also highlights the capacity of temperate forests to regulate regional water cycling in Northeast China. With high evapotranspiration, the forests could transfer sufficient moisture to the atmosphere. Combined with the associated moisture convergence, the temperate forests in Northeast China brought more rainfall in both forest and agricultural ecosystems. The increased rainfall was mainly concentrated in the spring and summer; these seasons accounted for 93.82% of the total increase in rainfall. These results imply that temperate forests make outstanding contributions to the maintainance of the sustainable development of agriculture in Northeast China.","[Jiao, Yue; Zhang, Hengqing] Liaoning Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dalian 116029, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Yue; Bu, Kun; Yang, Jiuchun; Li, Guangshuai; Yu, Lingxue; Zhang, Shuwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Res Ctr, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Li, Guangshuai; Liu, Tingxiang] Changchun Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Changchun 130031, Peoples R China; [Shen, Lidu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lingxue] Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Jingyuetan Remote Sensing Observat Stn, Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Res Ctr, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China","Liaoning Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Changchun Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Yu, LX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Res Ctr, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.;Yu, LX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Jingyuetan Remote Sensing Observat Stn, Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Res Ctr, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.",jiaoyue@iga.ac.cn; bukun@iga.ac.cn; yangjiuchun@iga.ac.cn; liguangshuai@iga.ac.cn; shenlidu@iae.ac.cn; liutingxiang@ccsfu.edu.cn; yulingxue@iga.ac.cn; zhangshuwen@iga.ac.cn; 100639@lnnu.edu.cn,"Guangshuai, Li/HGB-7976-2022; Jiao, Yue/ACS-4718-2022","Jiao, Yue/0000-0003-4160-4540; Yu, Lingxue/0000-0002-5565-535X",,,,,44,3,3,8,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,DEC,2021,23,,,,,,4767,10.3390/rs13234767,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13234767,,,16,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,YH1TS,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000742957400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The equal-weighed multi-model ensemble (MME) of six state-of-the-art models from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and Pusan National University (PNU) was analysed to understand the wintertime AO performance for the hindcast period December-February 1993/1994-2016/2017. The hindcasts were chosen with lead times of 1 and 4 months with respect to the initialization date (August and November, respectively). The spread of the AO prediction skills of the individual models was significant. In general, the MME demonstrates superior skill compared to the average of single-model skills in representing the AO pattern at lead times of 1 and 4 months. The AO-related vertical structure predicted by MME is similar to the observation, but the upper-level structure is relatively poor compared to the structure of the hindcasted lower- or mid-level atmosphere. Both observation and MME indicate that since the mid-1990s, the relationship between the AO and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) has been weak compared to the connection between the AO and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Simultaneously, the North Pacific centre of the AO moved eastward during the observational period. The MME showed an AO pattern similar to that observed. The eastward shift of the North Pacific centre of the AO may contribute to deepening the Aleutian low and its effect on the tight AO-ENSO relation demonstrated in observations and MME. Strong AO-ENSO relations and weak AO-EAWM connections are found in both observations and MME model. The observation and MME represent the wave activity flux from 60 degrees N to the equator in the troposphere; consequently, the wave activity flux may contribute to the AO and ENSO connection in both observation and MME.","[Kim, Gayoung] APEC Climate Ctr, Climate Serv & Res Div, Busan, South Korea; [Ahn, Joong-Bae] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Ahn, JB (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan 46241, South Korea.",jbahn@pusan.ac.kr,,"Kim, Gayoung/0000-0001-6002-386X","Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ01489102]; APEC Climate Center","Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea(Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea); APEC Climate Center","Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea, Grant/Award Number: PJ01489102; APEC Climate Center",,37,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

This study was designed to help gaining insight into how, in particular, increasing temperatures might affect grapevine canopies. We developed a functional-structural model for Riesling, Virtual Riesling, based on digitised data of real plants and a comprehensive state-of-the-art data analysis. The model accounts for the variability in temperature-sensitive morphological processes, such as bud break and appearance rates. Our simulation study using historical weather data revealed significant effects of the thermal time course over the year on bud burst of the cane and on primary shoots. High variabilities in these events affect canopy growth and leaf area distribution. This report shows that Virtual Riesling can be useful in assessing the significance of changing temperatures for grapevine architecture and thereby considering management techniques such as vertical shoot positioning. Further developments of Virtual Riesling might support the knowledge gain for developing necessary adaptations in future vineyard management and, thus, facilitate future work on climate change research using functional-structural model approaches.","[Schmidt, Dominik] Hsch Geisenhe Univ, Dept Modeling & Syst Anal, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; [Bahr, Christopher; Friedel, Matthias] Hsch Geisenhe Univ, Dept Gen & Organ Viticulture, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; [Kahlen, Katrin] Hsch Geisenhe Univ, Dept Vegetable Crops, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany",,"Schmidt, D (corresponding author), Hsch Geisenhe Univ, Dept Modeling & Syst Anal, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany.",dominik.schmidt@hs-gm.de,,"Schmidt, Dominik/0000-0001-9480-2001","Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK)","Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK)","Funds for this study were provided by The Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK).",,63,9,9,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,AUG,2019,8,,,,,,426,10.3390/agronomy9080426,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy9080426,,,29,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,IT6ML,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,12/21/22,WOS:000482988800028,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a climatological sense, Arctic cyclone behaviour is linked to the distributions of lower troposphere temperature and sea ice, and hence the monitoring of storms can be seen as an important component of the analysis of Arctic climate. The analysis of cyclone behaviour, however, is not without ambiguity, and different cyclone identification algorithms can lead to divergent conclusions. Here we analyse a subset of Arctic cyclones with 10 state-of-the-art cyclone identification schemes applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The subset is comprised of the five most intense (defined in terms of central pressure) Arctic cyclones for each of the 12 calendar months over the 30-yr period from 1 January 1979 to 31 March 2009. There is a considerable difference between the central pressures diagnosed by the algorithms of typically 5 - 10 hPa. By contrast, there is substantial agreement as to the location of the centre of these extreme storms. The cyclone tracking algorithms also display some differences in the evolution and life cycle of these storms, while overall finding them to be quite long-lived. For all but six of the 60 storms an intense tropopause polar vortex is identified within 555km of the surface system. The results presented here highlight some significant differences between the outputs of the algorithms, and hence point to the value using multiple identification schemes in the study of cyclone behaviour. Overall, however, the algorithms reached a very robust consensus on most aspects of the behaviour of these very extreme cyclones in the Arctic basin.","[Simmonds, Ian; Rudeva, Irina] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Simmonds, I (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",simmonds@unimelb.edu.au,,,Swiss Re; Australian Research Council,Swiss Re; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),We thank Swiss Re for sponsoring the IMILAST project (both with respect to its coordination office and workshops) and ECWMF for providing the ERA-Interim reanalysis.

Evaluating the ethics of offering reproductive services against its overall harm to the environment makes unregulated ARTs unjustified, yet the ART business can move towards sustainability as a part of the larger green bioethics movement. By integrating ecological ethos into the ART industry, climate change can be mitigated and the conversation about consumption can become a broader public discourse. Although the impact of naturally made children on the environment is undeniable, I will focus on the ART industry as an anthropogenic source of carbon emissions which lead to climate change. The ART industry is an often overlooked source of environmental degradation and decidedly different from natural reproduction as fertility centres provide a service for a fee and therefore can be subject to economic, policy and bioethical scrutiny. In this article, I will provide a brief background on the current state of human-driven climate change before suggesting two conservationist strategies that can be employed in the ART business. First, endorsing a carbon capping programme that limits the carbon emissions of ART businesses will be proposed. Second, I will recommend that policymakers eliminate funded ARTs for those who are not biologically infertile.

In this study we provide an overview of the existing knowledge regarding the chemical fate, biological dynamics and the ecological risks of chemicals underwater scarcity conditions. We evaluated a total of 15 studies dealing with the combined effects of chemicals and water scarcity under laboratory conditions and in the field. The results of these studies have been elaborated in order to evaluate additive, synergistic or antagonistic responses of the studied endpoints. As a general rule, it can be concluded that, in situations of water scarcity, the impacts of extreme water fluctuations are much more relevant than those of an additional chemical stressor. Nevertheless, the presence of chemical pollution may result in exacerbated ecological risks in some particular cases. We conclude that further investigations on this topic would take advantage on the focus on some specific issues. Experimental (laboratory and model ecosystem) studies should be performed on different biota groups and life stages (diapausing eggs, immature stages), with particular attention to those including traits relevant for the adaptation to water scarcity. More knowledge on species adaptations and recovery capacity is essential to predict community responses to multiple stressors and to assess the community vulnerability. Field studies should be performed at different scales, particularly in lotic systems, in order to integrate different functional dynamics of the river ecosystem. Combining field monitoring and experimental studies would be the best option to reach more conclusive, causal relationships on the effects of co-occurring stressors. Contribution of these studies to develop ecological models and scenarios is also suggested as an improvement for the prospective aquatic risk assessment of chemicals in (semi-) arid areas.

Recently, numerous researchers have utilized machine learning (ML) methods to predict crop yield, using observational climate variables and satellite data. Meanwhile, some studies also illustrated the potential of state-of-the-art dynamical atmospheric prediction in crop yield forecasting. However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML-dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale. In this study, we adopted three mainstream machining learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, and SVR) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and three major datasets, including satellite data from MOD13C1, observational climate data from CRU, and S2S atmospheric prediction data from IAP CAS, used to predict winter wheat yield from 2005 to 2014, at the grid level. We found that, among the four models examined in this work, XGBoost reached the highest skill with the S2S prediction as inputs, scoring R-2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.78 t/ha 3-4 months, leading the winter wheat harvest. Moreover, the results demonstrated that crop yield forecasting with S2S dynamical predictions generally outperforms that with observational climate data. Our findings highlighted that the coupling of ML and S2S dynamical atmospheric prediction provided a useful tool for yield forecasting, which could guide agricultural practices, policy-making and agricultural insurance.","[Cao, Junjun; Wang, Huijing] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Geog Proc Anal & Simulat Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Cao, Junjun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinxiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Tian, Qun] CMA, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Reg Numer Weather Predict, Guangzhou Inst Trop & Marine Meteorol, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Niyogi, Dev] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architecture & Environm Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Niyogi, Dev] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Central China Normal University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; China Meteorological Administration; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Li, JX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",caojun@ccnu.edu.cn; wanghjer@mails.ccnu.edu.cn; lijinxiao@lasg.iap.ac.cn; tianq@gd121.cn; happy1@utexas.edu,"Niyogi, Dev/H-6326-2013","Niyogi, Dev/0000-0002-1848-5080; , Junjun/0000-0003-4188-1505; Li, Jinxiao/0000-0003-1724-0513","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701111, 42005117]; Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research [2020B0301030004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research,"This work was funded by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ((Project Nos. 41701111, 42005117), and the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (Project No. 2020B0301030004).",,63,7,7,27,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,APR,2022,7,,,,,,1707,10.3390/rs14071707,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14071707,,,17,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,0L4UW,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000781471500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The state-of-the-art climate models can simulate this dominant mode variability to a large extent. Nevertheless, some of ENSO's fundamental time-space characteristics still have a large spread in the simulations across the array of recent climate models. For example, the large biases of ENSO periodicity still exist among model simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Based on the recharge oscillator framework, a coupled dynamic index for ENSO periodicity is proposed in this study, referred to as the Wyrtki index, in parallel to the Bjerknes index for ENSO instability. The Wyrtki index provides an approximate dynamic measure for ENSO linear periodicity. It has two main contribution terms: the thermocline and zonal advective feedbacks (or F factor) multiplied by the efficiency factor B of discharging-recharging of the equatorial heat content driven by ENSO wind stress anomalies. It is demonstrated that the diversity of simulated ENSO periodicity in CMIP5 models results from the biases in mean state and several key parameters that control ENSO dynamics. A larger F factor would result in a shorter ENSO period [e.g., BCC_CSM1.1(m)], whereas a smaller B factor would lead to a longer ENSO period (e.g., HadGEM2-ES). The Wyrtki index serves as a useful tool for a quantitative assessment of the sources for ENSO periodicity in reanalysis data and its biases in CMIP5 model simulations.","[Lu, Bo; Jin, Fei-Fei; Ren, Hong-Li] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Bo; Ren, Hong-Li] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jin, Fei-Fei] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ren, Hong-Li] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; Nanjing University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; China University of Geosciences,"Jin, FF (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Jin, FF (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jff@hawaii.edu,"Ren, Hong-Li/X-9632-2018","Ren, Hong-Li/0000-0001-7194-0567",China Meteorological Special Program [GYHY201506013]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602100]; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant [AGS-1406601]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Grant [DE-SC000511]; National Science Foundation of China [41605116],China Meteorological Special Program; National Key R&D Program of China; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Grant(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is jointly supported by China Meteorological Special Program (GYHY201506013), National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFA0602100), U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant AGS-1406601, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Grant DE-SC000511, and National Science Foundation of China (41605116).

Designs of Persian gardens have influenced and are used extensively in the gardens of Al-Andalus in Spain, Humayun's Tomb and the Taj Mahal in India, and many gardens in the United States and other countries around the globe. Bash in the Persian language (Farsi) means garden and the word Baghdad (the capital city of Iraq) is rooted from the words bash and daad (meaning the garden of justice). Pasargadae, the ancient Persian capital city, is the earliest example of Persian garden design known in human civilization as chahar bash or 4-fold garden design. Bagh-e-Eram, or Garden of Eden or Eram Garden, is one the most attractive Persian gardens and is located in Shiraz, Iran. There are numerous other urban ancient gardens in Iran, including Bagh-e-Shahzadeh (Shazdeh), meaning The Prince's Garden in Mahan, Golestan National Park near the Caspian Sea; Bagh-e-Fin in Kashan; Bagh-e-El-Goli in Tabriz; and Bagh-e-Golshan in Tabas. The design of each Persian garden is influenced by climate, art, beliefs, poetry, literature, and romance of the country and the region where the garden is located. In addition, each garden may have a gene bank of fruits, flowers, herbs, and vegetables. Although countless gardens were destroyed in the hands of invaders throughout the centuries, Persians have attempted either to rebuild or build new gardens generation after generation, each of which has become a favorite destination to tourists from around the world.","[Fallahi, Esmaeil; Mahdavi, Shahla] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Sci, 29603 U I Lane, Parma, ID 83660 USA; [Fallahi, Pontia] 1421 Narrow Lane Pkwy, Montgomery, AL 36111 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho,"Fallahi, E (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Sci, 29603 U I Lane, Parma, ID 83660 USA.",efallahi@uidaho.edu,,,,,,,26,4,4,4,14,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",1063-0198,1943-7714,,HORTTECHNOLOGY,HortTechnology,FEB,2020,1,,,,6,12,,10.21273/HORTTECH04415-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH04415-19,,,7,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,KJ4TR,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000512052100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, state-of-the-art climate models still disagree on the ENSO's response under climate change. The potential role of atmospheric ozone changes in this context has not been explored before. Here we show that differences between typical model representations of ozone can have a first-order impact on ENSO amplitude projections in climate sensitivity simulations. The vertical temperature gradient of the tropical middle-to-upper troposphere adjusts to ozone changes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, modifying the Walker circulation and consequently tropical Pacific surface temperature gradients. We show that neglecting ozone changes thus results in a significant increase in the number of extreme ENSO events in our model. Climate modeling studies of the ENSO often neglect changes in ozone. We therefore highlight the need to understand better the coupling between ozone, the tropospheric circulation, and climate variability.","[Nowack, Peer J.; Abraham, N.

This degradation is predicted to have consequences for many processes, which previous modelling studies have suggested would occur gradually. Here we project that soil moisture will decrease abruptly (within a few months) in response to permafrost degradation over large areas of the present-day permafrost region, based on analysis of transient climate change simulations performed using a state-of-the-art regional climate model. This regime shift is reflected in abrupt increases in summer near-surface temperature and convective precipitation, and decreases in relative humidity and surface runoff. Of particular relevance to northern systems are changes to the bearing capacity of the soil due to increased drainage, increases in the potential for intense rainfall events and increases in lightning frequency. Combined with increases in forest fuel combustibility, these are projected to abruptly and substantially increase the severity of wildfires, which constitute one of the greatest risks to northern ecosystems, communities and infrastructures.

The aim of this study is to quantify the DI error on precipitation in the tropical Pacific, with a specific focus on the relationship between the DI error and the representation of large-scale vertical circulation regimes in climate models. The DI rainfall signal is analyzed using a regime-sorting approach for the vertical circulation regimes. Through the use of this compositing technique, precipitation events are regime sorted based on the large-scale vertical motions, as represented by the midtropospheric Lagrangian pressure tendency omega(500) dynamical proxy. This methodology allows partition of the precipitation signal into deep and shallow convective components. Following the regime-sorting diagnosis, the total DI bias is split into an error affecting the magnitude of precipitation associated with individual convective events and an error affecting the frequency of occurrence of single convective regimes. It is shown that, despite the existing large intramodel differences, CGCMs can be ultimately grouped into a few homogenous clusters, each featuring a well-defined rainfall-vertical circulation relationship in the DI region. Three major behavioral clusters are identified within the AR4 models ensemble: two unimodal distributions, featuring maximum precipitation under subsidence and deep convection regimes, respectively, and one bimodal distribution, displaying both components. Extending this analysis to both coupled and uncoupled (atmosphere only) AR4 simulations reveals that the DI bias in CGCMs is mainly due to the overly frequent occurrence of deep convection regimes, whereas the error on rainfall magnitude associated with individual convective events is overall consistent with errors already present in the corresponding atmosphere stand-alone simulations. A critical parameter controlling the strength of the DI systematic error is identified in the model-dependent sea surface temperature (SST) threshold leading to the onset of deep convection (THR), combined with the average SST in the southeastern Pacific. The models featuring a THR that is systematically colder (warmer) than their mean surface temperature are more (less) prone to exhibit a spurious southern intertropical convergence zone.","[Bellucci, A.; Gualdi, S.; Navarra, A.] Ctr Euromediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climatici, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Gualdi, S.; Navarra, A.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Bellucci, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climatici, Viale A Moro 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",alessio.bellucci@cmcc.it,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921",Italian Ministry of Environment and Protection of Land and Sea; EU ENSEMBLES [GOCECT-2003-505539],Italian Ministry of Environment and Protection of Land and Sea; EU ENSEMBLES,"Stimulating discussions with Erich Roeckner.

The seagrass Zostera noltii forms meadows mainly within the intertidal zone, leading it to be particularly vulnerable to seawater temperature increase and sea level rise (SLR). Considering the presently declining situation and the predicted scenarios of increasing seawater temperature and SLR by the end of the 21st century, we assessed the response of Z. noltii to climate change (i) accounting for changes in seawater temperature at its entire biogeographical range level; and (ii) under SLR scenarios at estuary level (Oka estuary, Basque Country, south-eastern Bay of Biscay). Objectives were addressed coupling habitat suitability models with climate change simulations. By the end of the 21st century, seawater temperature increase will trigger a northward distributional shift of 888 km in the suitable habitat of the species, and a retreat of southernmost populations. The loss of southernmost populations due to climate change may imply future conservation problems. In contrast, SLR and derived changes in current velocities are expected to induce the landward migration of the species in the Oka estuary, increasing the available suitable intertidal areas (14-18%) to limits imposed by anthropogenic barriers. This modelling approach could lead to an advanced understanding of the species' response to climate change effects; moreover, the information generated might support conservation actions towards the sites where the habitat would remain suitable for the species under climate change.

However, the large-scale impact of drought time-scales on GPP is still not well understood, partly due to limited understanding of ecological processes and difficulties in quantifying drought time-scales. Here, we examined the responses of GPP to drought in China during the last four decades, using state-of-the-art GPP data estimates and a multiscalar drought metric. Most of the GPP data suggested that the time-scales at which drought has the largest influence on annual GPP (dominant drought time-scales) were well related to climate region and vegetation type. The GPP responded to drought more rapidly in arid regions than that in semiarid and subhumid regions, with a mean dominant drought time-scale of 15 and 20 months, respectively; as plants in arid regions can rapidly adapt to water shortage through physiological strategies, while, in semiarid and subhumid regions plants usually can withstand a degree of water deficits. In a humid region, GPP did not rapidly respond to drought, probably because the high soil water availability buffered the effect of drought. In addition, most of the GPP estimates suggested that grasslands and croplands tended to respond to drought at shorter time-scales than that of forests, shrublands, and sparse vegetation. The study highlights the importance of improving the effects of water availability on vegetation activity and further consideration of vegetation adaptability to drought in both remote sensing GPP algorithms and parameterizations of current terrestrial ecosystem models.","[Sun, Shaobo; Du, Wenli; Song, Zhaoliang; Zhang, Dongbo; Wu, Yuntao] Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shaobo; Song, Zhaoliang] Tianjin Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Earth Crit Zone Sci & Sustainable, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shaobo; Song, Zhaoliang] Tianjin Univ, Crit Zone Observ Bohai Coastal Reg, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiuchen] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Baozhang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Song, ZL (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;Song, ZL (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Earth Crit Zone Sci & Sustainable, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;Song, ZL (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Crit Zone Observ Bohai Coastal Reg, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",song@tju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41930862]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0606001]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City [20JCQNJC01560]; Peiyang Young Scholars Program of Tianjin University [2020XRG-0066],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); Peiyang Young Scholars Program of Tianjin University,"The study was supported by the research grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41801061), the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFA0606001), the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City (20JCQNJC01560), the Peiyang Young Scholars Program of Tianjin University (2020XRG-0066), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41930862).",,89,10,12,26,99,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-8953,2169-8961,,J GEOPHYS RES-BIOGEO,J.

In this work, we constrain a global aerosol model by using aircraft measurements to reveal the global importance of SOA formation in CCN production. Our improved model, with explicit size-resolved aerosol microphysics and parametrizations of semivolatile organic oxidation products, presents a state-of-the-art performance in simulating both particle number concentrations and organic aerosol concentrations dominated (80-95%) by SOA in the remote atmosphere, which have been challenges in previous modeling studies. The SOA formation in concert with aerosol nucleation contributes to more than 50% of CCN concentrations in those pristine environments featuring low background aerosol concentrations. We estimate that the SOA-derived CCN alters the magnitude of cloud radiative forcing by similar to 0.1 W m(-2). Our findings underscore the necessity for aerosol-climate models to represent controls on CCN concentrations by SOA production.","[Liu, Mingxu; Matsui, Hitoshi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Matsui, Hitoshi] Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Net Zero Carbon Soc, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Nagoya University; Nagoya University,"Matsui, H (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.;Matsui, H (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Res Ctr Net Zero Carbon Soc, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",matsui@nagoya-u.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (MEXT/JSPS) KAKENHI Grant [JP19H04253, JP19H05699, JP19KK0265, JP20H00196, JP20H00638, JP22H03722]; MEXT Arctic Challenge for Sustainability phase II (ArCS-II) projects [JPMXD1420318865]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency [2-2003 (JPMEERF20202003)]; JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research in Japan; Nagoya University Research Fund","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (MEXT/JSPS) KAKENHI Grant; MEXT Arctic Challenge for Sustainability phase II (ArCS-II) projects; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency; JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research in Japan; Nagoya University Research Fund","This work was funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (MEXT/JSPS) KAKENHI Grant Nos.

To assess the rainfall anomalies and the extent of farmers' dependency on rainwater for farming, a semi-structured questionnaire survey was conducted in six districts of the country, covering low-, mid- and high-altitude agro-ecosystems. A point score analysis showed that most farmers (50% or more) depended on rainwater for farming activities. The extent of farmers' dependency on rainfall across the districts was as high as 51%, except for Paro which had a lower dependency level of 10-20%. However, an overwhelming 40-80% of respondents had perception of decreased rain over the years, and the rainfall data for 20 years (1997-2017) showed a decreasing trend, reinforcing the survey findings. Moreover, up to 75% of respondents had perceptions of rain being untimely and unpredictable, including fewer incidences of short spells of high intensity or occasional prolonged periods of rains. The consequences of these issues were perceived to have caused (1) drying of water sources; (2) delay in planting; (3) erosion and infrastructure damage; and (4) work disruption. To overcome these issues, there is a need to overhaul Bhutan's irrigation system, in terms of both infrastructure development and methods as aspired by farmers. The need of the hour for Bhutan is to reduce dependency on rains with state-of-the-art irrigation technologies to buffer against the changing patterns of rain and to improve farmers' resilience to the impact of climate change.","[Chhogyel, Ngawang] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Chhogyel, Ngawang] Minist Agr & Forests, Dept Agr, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Bajo, Wangdue Phodran, Bhutan; [Kumar, Lalit] Eastcoast Geospatial Consultants, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Bajgai, Yadunath] Minist Agr & Forests, Dept Agr, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Natl Potato Program, Thimphu, Bhutan",University of New England,"Chhogyel, N (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.;Chhogyel, N (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Forests, Dept Agr, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Bajo, Wangdue Phodran, Bhutan.",nchhogye@myune.edu.au,"Bajgai, Yadunath/ABF-4536-2021","Bajgai, Yadunath/0000-0001-9822-2581; Chhogyel, Ngawang/0000-0002-1735-0651","University of New England (UNE), Armidale, NSW, in Australia","University of New England (UNE), Armidale, NSW, in Australia","The authors would like to thank the University of New England (UNE), Armidale, NSW, in Australia, for the International Postgraduate Research Award (PhD scholarship) to the senior author.

Due to the strategic geographical position of Italy and the high number of ports along coastlines, an increasing concern about maritime emissions from Italian harbours has been made explicit in the EU and IMO (International Maritime Organization, London, UK) agenda, also supporting the inclusion in a potential Mediterranean emission control area (MedECA). This work reviews the main available outcomes concerning shipping (and harbours') contributions to local air quality, particularly in terms of concentration of particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants (mainly nitrogen and sulphur oxides), in the main Italian hubs. Maritime emissions from literature and disaggregated emission inventories are discussed. Furthermore, estimated impacts to air quality, obtained with dispersion and receptor modeling approaches, which are the most commonly applied methodologies, are discussed. Results show a certain variability that suggests the necessity of harmonization among methods and input data in order to compare results.

Operations at lower and at higher power ranges decrease the efficiencies of these devices to some extent because of technical implications of the inverter. The nominal power of photovoltaic inverters is usually specified by the inverter manufacturer considering standard test conditions and/or normal operating conditions. If the inverters are oversized higher losses do appear as the inverter converts more energy at the lower power ranges and if the inverter is undersized higher energy losses appear as the inverter converts more energy at the higher power ranges. Especially due to the inverter's maximum power limitation a part of the disposable solar energy at very high incidences may be rejected by the solar inverters. Therefore a correct sizing defines an optimal solar generator size in relation to the inverter size which maximizes its yearly energy conversion. Due the inverters efficiency curve characteristic, an optimal sizing of the inverter depends on: (i) technological aspects of the solar inverter and photovoltaic modules, (ii) climatological aspects of the location where the inverter is installed and (iii) time resolutions considered for the simulations which have to be accomplished to obtain the yearly energy conversion. In the present work, different system configurations are simulated using the software PVsyst (TM) in order to assess and compare an optimized system configuration for three different locations, Capivari de Baixo-SC (Latitude 28 degrees S), Juazeiro do Norte-CE (Lat. 7 degrees S) in Brazil and Freiburg in Germany (Lat. 48 degrees N). The limits of the method are discussed and a method is proposed to assess to which extent the annual energy YIELD per unit of installed solar generator peak power can be improved and compared for different PV technologies. Considering a specific energy price, in either a net-metering or a feed-in tariff market (see e.g. [8]), the higher inverter investment cost due to an eventual over sizing of the inverter should be justified by a higher annual feed in revenue due to the higher amount of energy injected to the grid.

It detached at similar to 10 ka from the northeastern flank of the Kabir-Kuh anticline (Zagros Mountains, Iran) creating a natural dam responsible for the formation of a lake system that persisted for similar to 3 kyr during the early and mid-Holocene before its emptying phase caused by overflow. The chronology of its demise and connection to the Holocene climate variations have been barely studied. To reconstruct the influence of local vs. regional environmental changes upon the lake history and unravel their contribution on the lake overflowing phase, we analyzed 13 samples extracted from a 30-m-thick lacustrine succession belonging to Seymareh Lake. We performed grain size analysis, carbon and oxygen stable isotopes of carbonate-bearing sediments, and X-ray diffraction analysis of clay minerals, in addition to the geomorphological analysis to reconstruct the lake system morphoevolution. Main results highlight that the lake infilling phase was characterized by a first period (from 9.73 +/- 0.13 to 7.37 +/- 0.73 ka) with a median sedimentation rate of similar to 2 cm yr(-1) and a second period (from 7.37 +/- 0.73 to 6.98 +/- 0.39 ka) marked by an increased sedimentation rate up to similar to 10 cm yr(-1). The age of 6.98 +/- 0.39 ka is here considered as the termination of lacustrine sedimentation and the beginning of lake emptying and new valley entrenchment. Stable isotope and X-ray diffraction analyses confirm a stable humid interval after the early-mid Holocene arid to humid transition, consistent with other regions of the Middle East. During this transition, rainfall seasonality and its inter-annual irregularity may have prevented the development of a widespread vegetation cover that likely favored the increase of denudation rates on hillslopes and sediment supply along connected channels network. Therefore, the sedimentation rate increased within the downstream lake basin. However, in the late infilling phase from similar to 7.6-7.32 ka, local high energy hydroclimatic events, characterized by high sand content and low delta O-18 concentration, were recorded more frequently. This could justify a sudden increase in the tributaries' discharge that culminated at similar to 7.3 ka because of the complete overflow of Jaidar Lake into Seymareh Lake likely causing the overflowing of the entire Seymareh landslide-dam lake system.","[Delchiaro, Michele; Iacobucci, Giulia; Troiani, Francesco; Della Seta, Marta; Aldega, Luca] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Earth Sci, Rome, Italy; [Ballato, Paolo] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Sci, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Italfarmaco; Roma Tre University,"Delchiaro, M (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Earth Sci, Rome, Italy.",michele.delchiaro@uniroma1.it,"Delchiaro, Michele/HHN-4480-2022; delchiaro, michele/HFZ-8000-2022","delchiaro, michele/0000-0002-0843-1003","Sapienza University of Rome [RM120172A260A846]; MIUR (Ministry of Education, University and Research); Excellence Department Initiative;  [Prin_2017 20177BX42Z]","Sapienza University of Rome; MIUR (Ministry of Education, University and Research)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Excellence Department Initiative; ","We would like first to thank Luigi Marino, Luigi Stedile and Tania Ruspandini of Department of Earth Sciences at Sapienza University of Rome for their help in performing the grain size and SEM analysis, as well as Alexis Licht and Andrew Schauer for the stable isotope analysis at IsoLab, University of Washington.

The UW theta-sigma and sigma gridpoint models utilize the flux form of the primitive equations, while CCM2 is based on the spectral representation and uses semi-Lagrangian transport (SLT) for trace constitutents. Results are also compared against a version of the CCM that uses spectral transport for the trace constituent. These comparisons 1) contrast the spatial and temporal evolution of the filamentary transport of inert trace constitutents simulated with the UW theta-sigma and sigma models against a ''state of the art'' GCM under both isentropic and nonisentropic conditions and 2) examine the ability of the models to conserve the initial trace constituent maximum value during 10-day integrations. Results show that the spatial distributions of trace constituent evolve in a similar manner, regardless of the transport scheme or model type. However, when compared to the UW theta-sigma model's ability to simulate filamentary structure and conserve the initial trace constituent maximum value, results from the other models in this study indicate substantial spurious dispersion. The more accurate conservation demonstrated with the UW theta-sigma model is especially noticeable within extratropical amplifying baroclinic waves, and it stems from the dominance of two-dimensional, quasi-horizontal isentropic exchange processes in a stratified baroclinic atmosphere. This condition, which largely precludes spurious numerical dispersion associated with vertical advection, is unique to isentropic coordinates. conservation of trace constituent maxima in sigma coordinates suffers from the complexity of, and inherent need for, resolving three-dimensional transport in the presence of vertical wind shear during baroclinic amplification, a condition leading to spurious vertical dispersion. The experiments of this study also indicate that the shape-preserving SLT scheme used in CCM2 further reduces conservation of the initial maximum value when compared to the spectral transport of trace constituents, although the patterns are more coherent and the Gibbs phenomenon is eliminated.",,,"Zapotocny, TH (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,CTR SPACE SCI & ENGN,1225 W DAYTON ST,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,,,,,,,38,12,12,0,0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693",0027-0644,,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

Access to adequate and nutritious food is essential to human wellbeing, peace and tranquillity. The relation between soil/environmental scarcity and conflict is complex, and security can only be universal, rather than local or regional, in the present era of globalization. Civil strife and conflict can be caused by both resource paucity and rapacity. Anthropogenic perturbations leading to soil degradation, climate volatility and growing human demands (e.g., food, energy, water, minerals) derived from soil are potential flash points triggering violence at local, regional and global scales. Among different types of drought, pedological and agronomic droughts are triggered by soil degradation, decline in available water capacity of the root zone and changes in the hydrological cycle. Several regions with unstable governments are prone to water scarcity and conflicts. Soil affects world peace through its impact on the quest for victuals, which enhances the relevance of the Peak Soil concept. Economic development and environmental enhancement must go hand in hand, and the highest priority must be given to development of the ecosphere. Depicting soil as a work of art for portraying cultural, aesthetical and ecological values can increase public awareness. A Greener Revolution can be ushered in through judicious soil and environmental governance. Maintaining peace and harmony necessitates that soil resources are used, improved, restored and never taken for granted.","Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lal, R (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, 2021 Coffey Rd,210 Kottman Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lal.1@osu.edu,"Lal, Rattan/D-2505-2013",,,,,,101,18,19,0,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

As a result, a plethora of SDS methods is nowadays available to climate scientists, which has motivated recent efforts for their comprehensive evaluation, like the VALUE initiative (http://www.value-cost.eu , last access: 29 March 2020). The systematic intercomparison of a large number of SDS techniques undertaken in VALUE, many of them independently developed by different authors and modeling centers in a variety of languages/environments, has shown a compelling need for new tools allowing for their application within an integrated framework. In this regard, downscaleR is an R package for statistical downscaling of climate information which covers the most popular approaches (model output statistics - including the so-called bias correction methods - and perfect prognosis) and state-of-the-art techniques. It has been conceived to work primarily with daily data and can be used in the framework of both seasonal forecasting and climate change studies. Its full integration within the climate4R framework (Iturbide et al., 2019) makes possible the development of end-to-end downscaling applications, from data retrieval to model building, validation, and prediction, bringing to climate scientists and practitioners a unique comprehensive framework for SDS model development. In this article the main features of downscaleR are showcased through the replication of some of the results obtained in VALUE, placing an emphasis on the most technically complex stages of perfect-prognosis model calibration (predictor screening, cross-validation, and model selection) that are accomplished through simple commands allowing for extremely flexible model tuning, tailored to the needs of users requiring an easy interface for different levels of experimental complexity. As part of the open-source climate4R framework, downscaleR is freely available and the necessary data and R scripts to fully replicate the experiments included in this paper are also provided as a companion notebook.","[Bedia, Joaquin; Manzanas, Rodrigo; Herrera, Sixto; Casanueya, Ana; Cofino, Antonio S.] Univ Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Ciencias Computac, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Bano-Medina, Jorge; Legasa, Mikel N.; Iturbide, Maialen; Manuel Gutierrez, Jose] Univ Cantabria, CSIC, Inst Fis Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [San-Martin, Daniel] Predictia Intelligent Data Solut, Santander 39005, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Cantabria; CSIC - Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria (IFCA),"Bedia, J (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Ciencias Computac, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",bediaj@unican.es,"Casanueva, Ana/L-4055-2015; Bedia, Joaquin/Q-2148-2015; Manzanas, R./A-7747-2013; Gutiérrez, José M./C-5754-2009; Legasa, Mikel/AFE-8384-2022; Gutiérrez, José/GSJ-1846-2022; García, Sixto Herrera/A-2573-2015","Casanueva, Ana/0000-0002-7568-0229; Bedia, Joaquin/0000-0001-6219-4312; Manzanas, R./0000-0002-0001-3448; Legasa, Mikel/0000-0003-0470-8068; García, Sixto Herrera/0000-0002-5384-179X; Cofino, Antonio S./0000-0001-7719-979X; Bano-Medina, Jorge/0000-0003-3380-1579; San Martin, Daniel/0000-0002-2862-2704","MULTI-SDM project (MINECO/FEDER) [CGL2015-66583-R]; project INDECIS, part of the European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ERA4CS); European Union [690462]","MULTI-SDM project (MINECO/FEDER); project INDECIS, part of the European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ERA4CS); European Union(European Commission)","The authors acknowledge partial funding from the MULTI-SDM project (MINECO/FEDER, CGL2015-66583-R) and from the project INDECIS, part of the European Research Area for Climate Services Consortium (ERA4CS) with co-funding by the European Union (grant no. 690462).",,77,19,19,5,18,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

J,"Whitehouse, P",,,,"Whitehouse, Peter",,,The music of trees: the intergenerative tie between primary care and public health,LONDON JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Metaphor; narrative; ecology; public health; arts,,"Stories help us frame and understand complex ideas and challenges. Metaphors are particularly powerful linguistic devices that guide and extend our thinking by bridging conceptual domains, for example to consider the brain as a digital computer. Trees are widely used as metaphors for broad concepts like evolution, history, society, and even life itself, i.e. 'the tree of life'. Tree-like diagrams of roots and branches are used to demonstrate historical and cultural relationships, for example, between different species or different languages. In this paper, we describe a theatrical character called a tree doctor which is a living metaphor. A human being, namely the author, lectures, acts or dances as a tree and offers lessons to Homo Sapiens about 'holistic' ideas of health. The character teaches us to not only see the value of our relationships to trees, but the importance of seeing forests as well the individual trees. The metaphorical statement that we should not 'miss the forest for the trees' means we should learn to think of health embedded in systems and communities. In medicine, we too often focus on individual molecules, pharmaceuticals, or even patients and miss the bigger picture of public and environmental health. In a time of great ecological system change, the tree doctor points to broad ethical responsibility for each other and future generations of humans and other living creatures. The character embraces arts and particularly music as a powerful way of infusing purpose and improving the qualities of our lives together, especially as we age. The tree doctor knows the value of intergenerational relationships. But it also points to intergenerative innovations across many cultural domains, disciplines and professions. The tree doctor supports primary care and empowers the value of intergenerational relationships, art and music in the recommendations doctors make to patients to improve their health and well-being.","[Whitehouse, Peter] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Neurol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Whitehouse, Peter] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Whitehouse, Peter] Intergenerat Sch Int, Cleveland, OH 44113 USA",Case Western Reserve University; University of Toronto,"Whitehouse, P (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Neurol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Whitehouse, P (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Whitehouse, P (corresponding author), Intergenerat Sch Int, Cleveland, OH 44113 USA.",peter.whitehouse@case.edu,,,Spitz Family (through University Hospitals of Cleveland); Shigeo and Megumi Takayama Foundation (Tokyo); National Institutes of Health (Washington),Spitz Family (through University Hospitals of Cleveland); Shigeo and Megumi Takayama Foundation (Tokyo); National Institutes of Health (Washington),"Thanks to the Spitz Family (through University Hospitals of Cleveland) and the Shigeo and Megumi Takayama Foundation (Tokyo) for generous and liberating funding.

However, it is still not known how many Arctic animals will respond to a changing climate with altered trophic interactions. We studied clutch size, incubation duration and nest survival of 17 taxa of Arctic-breeding shorebirds at 16 field sites over 7years. We predicted that physiological benefits of higher temperatures and earlier snowmelt would increase reproductive effort and nest survival, and we expected increasing predator abundance and decreasing abundance of alternative prey (arvicoline rodents) to have a negative effect on reproduction. Although we observed wide ranges of conditions during our study, we found no effects of covariates on reproductive traits in 12 of 17 taxa. In the remaining taxa, most relationships agreed with our predictions. Earlier snowmelt increased the probability of laying a full clutch from 0.61 to 0.91 for Western Sandpipers, and shortened incubation by 1.42days for arcticola Dunlin and 0.77days for Red Phalaropes. Higher temperatures increased the probability of a full clutch from 0.60 to 0.93 for Western Sandpipers and from 0.76 to 0.97 for Red-necked Phalaropes, and increased daily nest survival rates from 0.9634 to 0.9890 for Semipalmated Sandpipers and 0.9546 to 0.9880 for Western Sandpipers. Higher abundance of predators (foxes) reduced daily nest survival rates only in Western Sandpipers (0.9821-0.9031). In contrast to our predictions, the probability of a full clutch was lowest (0.83) for Semipalmated Sandpipers at moderate abundance of alternative prey, rather than low abundance (0.90). Our findings suggest that in the short-term, climate warming may have neutral or positive effects on the nesting cycle of most Arctic-breeding shorebirds.","[Weiser, Emily L.; Kwon, Eunbi; Sandercock, Brett K.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Brown, Stephen C.; Gates, H.

Key drivers of ecosystem change and potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and Arctic marine food webs are identified along the sea-ice gradient, with special emphasis on the following regions: seasonally ice-free Barents and Chukchi seas, loose ice pack zone of the Polar Front and Marginal Ice Zone, and permanently sea-ice covered High Arctic.

Part 2 (OttoBliesner et al., 2017) gives details about the two PMIP4-CMIP6 interglacial experiments, Part 3 (Jungclaus et al., 2017) about the last millennium experiment, and Part 4 (Kageyama et al., 2017) about the Last Glacial Maximum experiment. The mid-Pliocene Warm Period experiment is part of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) Phase 2, detailed in Haywood et al. (2016). The goal of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) is to understand the response of the climate system to different climate forcings for documented climatic states very different from the present and historical climates. Through comparison with observations of the environmental impact of these climate changes, or with climate reconstructions based on physical, chemical, or biological records, PMIP also addresses the issue of how well state-of-the-art numerical models simulate climate change. Climate models are usually developed using the present and historical climates as references, but climate projections show that future climates will lie well outside these conditions. Palaeoclimates very different from these reference states therefore provide stringent tests for state-of-the-art models and a way to assess whether their sensitivity to forcings is compatible with palaeoclimatic evidence. Simulations of five different periods have been designed to address the objectives of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6): the millennium prior to the industrial epoch (CMIP6 name: past1000); the mid-Holocene, 6000 years ago (midHolocene); the Last Glacial Maximum, 21 000 years ago (lgm); the Last Interglacial, 127 000 years ago (lig127k); and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, 3.2 million years ago (midPliocene-eoi400). These climatic periods are well documented by palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental records, with climate and environmental changes relevant for the study and projection of future climate changes. This paper describes the motivation for the choice of these periods and the design of the numerical experiments and database requests, with a focus on their novel features compared to the experiments performed in previous phases of PMIP and CMIP. It also outlines the analysis plan that takes advantage of the comparisons of the results across periods and across CMIP6 in collaboration with other MIPs.","[Kageyama, Masa; Braconnot, Pascale; Peterschmitt, Jean-Yves; Albani, Samuel; Roche, Didier M.] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA CNRS UVSQ, LSCE, IPSL, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, Ctr Climate Change, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Harrison, Sandy P.] Univ Reading, Sch Archaeol Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AH, Berks, England; [Haywood, Alan M.; Dolan, Aisling; Ivanovic, Ruza F.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Jungclaus, Johann H.; Dolan, Aisling; Ivanovic, Ruza F.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Otto-Bliesner, Bette L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, 1850 Table Mesa Dr, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, 3173-25 Showamachi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Albani, Samuel] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany; [Bartlein, Patrick J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Geog, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Brierley, Chris] UCL, Dept Geog, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Crucifix, Michel] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain, Belgium; [Fernandez-Donado, Laura] Univ Complutense Madrid, Inst Geociencias, CSIC, Dept Fis Tierra Astron & Astrofis 2, Madrid, Spain; [Fischer, Hubertus] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys Phys Inst, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischer, Hubertus] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Hopcroft, Peter O.; Lunt, Daniel J.; Valdes, Paul J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Hopcroft, Peter O.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Lambert, Fabrice] Catholic Univ Chile, Dept Phys Geog, Santiago, Chile; [Mahowald, Natalie M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Bradfield 1112, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Peltier, W.

Improving the efficiency of climate control systems requires advanced simulation tools for an accurate evaluation of both the energy savings and thermal comfort of innovative heating and cooling solutions. In this study, the advancements beyond the state of the art consists primarily of the methodology tackling the reduction of computational costs of intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and/or time-consuming experimental investigations and the simultaneous assessment of vehicle cabin thermal comfort and energy flows. The approach was validated against climatized chassis dyno measurements from the EU Horizon 2020 research project QUIET. Indeed, all the considered locations within the cabin were properly validated, both in steady state and transient conditions with the largest deviations at steady state below 3 degrees C. Additionally, the validation results show a perfect agreement for the average cabin predicted mean vote (PMV) value and a largest deviation in terms of the PMV for the other locations below 0.3. Furthermore, the applicability of the methodology is proved with the help of its application on a parametric study for which various cabin temperature setpoints and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modes were simulated in winter operation.","[Basciotti, Daniele; Dvorak, Dominik; Gellai, Imre] AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Giefinggasse 4, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Basciotti, D (corresponding author), AIT Austrian Inst Technol, Giefinggasse 4, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",daniele.basciotti@ait.ac.at; dominik.dvorak@ait.ac.at; imre.gellai@ait.ac.at,,"Gellai, Imre/0000-0003-3501-5563",European Union [769826],European Union(European Commission),The QUIET project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 769826.

Previous research, based on geological proxies, has provided invaluable insights into past AMOC changes. However, the causes of the changes in water mass distributions in the Atlantic during different periods remain mostly elusive. Using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we show that the bulk of NCW in the deep South Atlantic Ocean below 4000 m migrated from the western basins at 125 ka to the eastern basins at 115 ka, though the AMOC strength is only slightly reduced. These changes are consistent with proxy records, and it is mainly due to more penetration of the AABW at depth at 115 ka, as a result of a larger density of AABW formed at 115 ka. Our results show that depth changes in regional deep water pathways can result in large local changes, while the overall AMOC structure hardly changes. Future research should thus be careful when interpreting single proxy records in terms of large-scale AMOC changes, and considering variability of water-mass distributions on sub-basin scale would give more comprehensive interpretations of sediment records.","[Luo, Yiming] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Luo, Yiming] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Tjiputra, Jerry; Guo, Chuncheng; Zhang, Zhongshi] Uni Res Climate, Jahnebakken 5, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Tjiputra, Jerry; Guo, Chuncheng; Zhang, Zhongshi] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Jahnebakken 5, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Lippold, Joerg] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Neuenheimer Feld 234, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Luo, YM (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.;Luo, YM (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",yiming.luo@uib.no,"Tjiputra, Jerry/AAB-5896-2022; Guo, Chuncheng/G-3654-2019; Zhang, zs/GXN-3521-2022; Zhang, Zhongshi/L-2891-2013","Guo, Chuncheng/0000-0001-6276-6499; Zhang, Zhongshi/0000-0002-2354-1622; Tjiputra, Jerry/0000-0002-4600-2453","project BIGCHANGE - Centre for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Centre; Research Council of Norway [239965, 254964]; European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC [610055]",project BIGCHANGE - Centre for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Centre; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC,"The research was supported by project BIGCHANGE funded by the Centre for Climate Dynamics at the Bjerknes Centre.

Its objective, therefore, is to reflect on the magnitude of the socioenvironmental, climate and health crises and on the contribution that environmental education in schools can offer to reverse or mitigate the existing threats. The scientific and daily evidence reveals worrying signs that affect the state of the biosphere, human well-being and health, the food security of populations, the maintenance of peace and democracy and, ultimately, the very survival of the human species on planet earth. In these terms, allusion to narratives of collapse, catastrophe, rupture, decay and the end of the world is becoming more and more frequent in discourse and the social imaginary. Methodologically, the text dialogues with socioenvironmental literature, with contributions from critical environmental education, political ecology, conflicts and socioenvironmental justice. The reflection concludes that in the face of the challenges posed, environmental education in schools cannot surrender to social and pedagogical reproductionism.

This reduction has important social and economic implications, as water retained in the snowpack from winter storms forms an important part of the hydrological cycle and water supply in the region. A formal model-based detection and attribution (D-A) study of these reductions is performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) to water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to reduce the effect of P variability on the results. Estimates of natural internal climate variability are obtained from 1600 years of two control simulations performed with fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and some aerosols are taken from multiple-member ensembles of perturbation experiments run with two models. The D-A shows the observations and anthropogenically forced models have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained by natural internal climate variability alone. Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P reductions. The mean model estimate is that about half of the SWE/P reductions observed in the west from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols.","[Pierce, David W.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Atmospher Sci & Phys Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bonfils, Celine; Santer, Benjamin D.; Bala, Govindasamy; Mirin, Art] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA USA; [Dettinger, Michael D.; Cayan, Daniel R.] US Geol Survey, La Jolla, CA USA; [Wood, Andrew W.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nozawa, Toru] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Pierce, DW (corresponding author), Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Climate Atmospher Sci & Phys Oceanog, Mail Stop 0224, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dpierce@ucsd.edu,"Dettinger, Michael/AAW-5759-2020; Santer, Benjamin D/F-9781-2011; Bonfils, Celine/H-2356-2012; Wood, Andrew/L-5133-2013; Hidalgo, Hugo G./I-7170-2019; Bala, Govindasamy/ABF-3255-2020; Santer, Ben/ABA-1099-2021","Bonfils, Celine/0000-0002-4674-5708; Wood, Andrew/0000-0002-6231-0085; Hidalgo, Hugo G./0000-0003-4638-0742; Bala, Govindasamy/0000-0002-3079-0600; ",,,,,52,187,188,1,39,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

Creating a stable environment by providing a nearly constant temperature and relative humidity at correct levels decreases the risk of object degradation. Maintaining this steady indoor environment, however, increases energy consumption and risks to the historic building. Museum display cases offer a solution to the mitigation of risks to which valuable objects may be subjected by providing an extra layer of protection to indoor climate fluctuations. The Anne Frank House is a historic house museum located in Amsterdam. The museum has undergone several renovations in the last years to deal with an increase in the number of visitors to over 1.2 million a year. The original diaries and other documents of Anne Frank are permanently on display in the Anne Frank House. With the recent refurbishment the possibility arose to design a new state-of-the-art display case. This study presents the results of the experimental research related to the design, performed in-situ. The temperature and relative humidity in the new exhibition space and inside the new display cases were monitored to gain insight into the hygrothermal behavior of these controlled environments. A complementary numerical study was performed to investigate effects of dynamic climate control of the exhibition gallery and climate conditions in the display case under various circumstances. Four main conclusions are presented in this paper. The investigated display case design is able to provide a stable relative humidity environment by means of silica gel, while using an active box-in-box climate control system to create stable temperature conditions. The inner case temperature depends on the temperature supplied by the display case air handling unit. Protocols must be in place in case of malfunction or failure of the climate control system of the display case. The air handling unit of the case needs to be shut off to create a passive environment for the objects on display until necessary actions are taken. Exhibition gallery set points can be less stringent when susceptible museum objects are on display in the display case. The environments are separated and provide an opportunity for energy saving set point strategies. The last conclusion drawn is that the numerical study provides valuable insight into imposing dynamic control of set points for temperature and relative humidity in the exhibition gallery and the effect on the display case environment.","[Kompatscher, Karin; van Aarle, Marcel A.

These pathogens deteriorate grapevine berry quality either directly via the modulation of fruit metabolic pathways and the production of endogenous compounds associated with bad taste and/or flavor, or indirectly via their impact on vine physiology. The most common and devastating fungal diseases in viticulture are gray mold, downy mildew (DM), and powdery mildew (PM), caused, respectively by Botrytis cinerea, Plasmopara viticola, and Erysiphe necator. Whereas B. cinerea mainly infects and deteriorates the ripening fruit directly, deteriorations by DM and PM are mostly indirect via a reduction of photosynthetic leaf area. Nevertheless, mildews can also infect berries at certain developmental stages and directly alter fruit quality via the biosynthesis of unpleasant flavor compounds that impair ultimate wine quality. The grapevine is furthermore host of a wide range of viruses that reduce vine longevity, productivity and berry quality in different ways. The most widespread virus-related diseases, that are known nowadays, are Grapevine Leafroll Disease (GLRD), Grapevine Fanleaf Disease (GFLD), and the more recently characterized grapevine red blotch disease (GRBD). Future climatic conditions are creating a more favorable environment for the proliferation of most virus-insect vectors, so the spread of virus-related diseases is expected to increase in most wine-growing regions. However, the impact of climate change on the evolution of fungal disease pressure will be variable and depending on region and pathogen, with mildews remaining certainly the major phytosanitary threat in most regions because their development rate is to a large extent temperature-driven. This paper aims to provide a review of published literature on most important grapevine fungal and viral pathogens and their impact on grape berry physiology and quality. Our overview of the published literature highlights gaps in our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, which are valuable for conceiving future research programs dealing with the different pathogens and their impacts on grapevine berry quality and metabolism.","[Rienth, Markus; Vigneron, Nicolas] Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Oenol, Nyon, Switzerland; [Walker, Robert P.; Famiani, Franco] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agrarie Alimentari & Ambiental, Perugia, Italy; [Castellarin, Simone Diego] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Wine Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Sweetman, Crystal] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Burbidge, Crista A.] CSIRO, Sch Agr & Food, Glen Osmond, SA, Australia; [Bonghi, Claudio] Univ Padova Agripolis, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Animals & Environm, Legnaro, Italy; [Darriet, Philippe] Univ Bordeaux, Inst Sci Vigne & Vin, Unite Rech OEnol, INRAE,USC 1366,EA 4577, Villenave Dornon, France",University of Perugia; University of British Columbia; Flinders University South Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Padua; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Rienth, M (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Art Western Switzerland, Changins Coll Viticulture & Oenol, Nyon, Switzerland.",markus.rienth@hes-so.ch,"Darriet, Philippe/AAC-9989-2022; bonghi, claudio/F-3738-2017; Burbidge, Crista Ann/H-2784-2013; Famiani, Franco/L-9202-2015","Darriet, Philippe/0000-0002-7202-8710; Burbidge, Crista Ann/0000-0002-1377-4393; Sweetman, Crystal/0000-0002-7922-8205; Rienth, Markus/0000-0002-6302-6297; Famiani, Franco/0000-0002-9634-7951",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [IZCOZ0_189896],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The postdoc of NV was financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) Project Grant IZCOZ0_189896.,,121,3,3,10,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Compared to its predecessor CMIP3, the fifth phase of the homonymous experiment-CMIP5 involves a greater number of GCMs, run at higher resolutions with more complex components. Here we use daily GCM data from both projects to test their efficiency in representing precipitation and temperature parameters with the use of a state of the art high resolution gridded global dataset for land areas and for the period 1960-2005. Two simple metrics, a comprehensive histogram similarity metric based on the match of simulated and observed empirical pdfs and a metric for the representation of the annual cycle were employed as performance indicators. The metrics were used to assess the skill of each GCM at the entire spectrum of precipitation and temperature pdfs but also for the upper and lower tails of it. Results are presented globally and regionally for 26 land regions that represent different climatic regimes, covering the total earth's land surface except for Antarctica. Compared to CMIP3, CMIP5 models perform better in simulating precipitation including relatively intense events and the fraction of wet days. For temperature the improvement is not as clear except for the upper and lower hot and cold events of the distribution. The agreement of model simulations is also considerably increased in CMIP5. Substantial improvement in intense precipitation is observed over North Europe, Central and Eastern North America and North East Europe. Nevertheless, in both ensembles some models clearly perform better than others from a histogram similarity point of view. The derived skill score metrics provide essential information for impact studies based on global or regional land area multi-model ensembles.","[Koutroulis, A. G.; Grillakis, M. G.; Tsanis, I.

For this presentation we'll focus on potential applications of these GMS for air quality measurements of the species ozone O-3, formaldehyde HCHO and carbon monoxide CO. We will discuss these applications at various levels of complexity and the commensurate value for application to understanding and forecasting air quality. At lowest complexity we would utilize a single GMS operating in the solar reflective infrared region for column measurements Of O-3 and HCHO. A more complex approach would utilize a second and/or third GMS for thermal emissive O-3 measurements that provide improved vertical resolution, and for CO profile. Our major emphasis is the lowest tropospheric air layer 0-2 km. For realistic models of these GMS we'll present retrieval performance as predicted by a linear error analysis. In a polar leo orbit the most complex approach could provide twice daily global mapping with some footprints as small as 1.6 km at nadir. We'll present results from an in house lab demonstration GMS.

Results are validated against the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis, ERA-20C. Our findings indicate that the variability of ENSO has a significant impact on the low and middle tropospheric circulation of EMed. La Nina (El Nino) events are related to stronger (weaker) ISM activity, which leads to a deepening (weakening) of the Persian low that affects the EMed tropospheric circulation with stronger (weaker) northerly surface winds over the area. Further, La Nina (El Nino) events are related with stronger (weaker) 500 hPa subsidence over the EMed and an intensification (weakening) of the Subtropical Jet Stream between 35 degrees N to 50 degrees N. This work improves our understanding of the teleconnections between ENSO variability and the EMed summer tropospheric circulation via the modulation of the ISM activity and stresses the importance of ENSO on the EMed climate in summer.","[Logothetis, Ioannis; Tourpali, Kleareti] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Sci, Lab Atmospher Phys, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Dafka, Stella; Xoplaki, Elena] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Geog, Climatol Climate Dynam & Climate Change, Giessen, Germany; [Misios, Stergios] Univ Oxford, Dept Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [Zanis, Prodromos] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Geol, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Xoplaki, Elena; Luterbacher, Juerg] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res ZEU, Giessen, Germany; [Luterbacher, Juerg] World Meteorol Org WMO, Dept Sci & Innovat, Geneva, Switzerland; [Papagianoulis, Eleftherios] Univ Zurich, Dept Biostat, Zurich, Switzerland",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Oxford; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Zurich,"Logothetis, I (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Sci, Lab Atmospher Phys, Thessaloniki, Greece.",ilogothe@physics.auth.gr,"Misios, Stergios/GPT-4347-2022","Logothetis, Ioannis/0000-0001-8581-0595",Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT); Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) [1844/95544],Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT)(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI),The authors acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling which is responsible for CMIP along with the climate modelling groups (listed in Table 1 of this study) for producing and making available their model output.

Some of it is due to energy consumption inside buildings, which depends on building use and human behaviour, both of which are very heterogeneous in most urban areas. Urban canopy parametrisations (UCP), such as the Town Energy Balance (TEB), parametrise the effect of the buildings on the urban surface energy balance. They contain a simple building energy model. However, the variety of building use and human behaviour at grid point scale has not yet been represented in state of the art UCPs. In this study, we describe how we enhance the Town Energy Balance in order to take fractional building use and human behaviour into account. We describe how we parametrise different behaviours and initialise the model for applications in France. We evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of the simulated building energy consumption for the city of Toulouse. We show that a more detailed description of building use and human behaviour enhances the simulation results. The model developments lay the groundwork for simulations of coupled urban climate and building energy consumption which are relevant for both the urban climate and the climate change mitigation and adaptation communities.","[Schoetter, Robert; Masson, Valery] Meteo France CNRS, CNRM UMR 3589, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France; [Bourgeois, Alexis; Levy, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, LATTS UMR CNRS 8134, Ecole Ponts ParisTech, 6-8 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-77455 Champs Sur Marne 2, Marne La Vallee, France; [Pellegrino, Margot] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Lab Urba GU, 5 Blvd Descartes, F-77420 Champs Sur Marne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Meteo France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Schoetter, R (corresponding author), Meteo France CNRS, CNRM UMR 3589, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France.",robert.schoetter@meteo.fr,,,French National Agency of Research for the project applied Modelling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy (MApUCE) [ANR-13-VBDU-0004],French National Agency of Research for the project applied Modelling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban Climate and Energy (MApUCE),"We thank Gregoire Pigeon for providing original code and data required for the construction of the inventory of building energy consumption and for discussions concerning the building energy model in TEB.

However, a lack of an extensive historical rainfall record has long served as an obstacle to furthering the understanding of tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Advances have been made in the last few decades in rainfall observational techniques, allowing for the development of robust statistical tropical cyclone rainfall models. However, these current models are unable to capture statistical variability in rainfall intensities (i.e.,only mean rainfall rates can be predicted) or they cannot simulate rainfall over land. A new tropical cyclone rainfall model is developed herein using satellite rainfall observations, in which the tropical cyclone rainfall is modeled through a Weibull distribution conditioned upon maximum surface wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST). Satellites are able to capture rainfall observations in the most extreme events, unlike surface rain gauges, which tend to fail under high winds, thereby allowing for the consideration of the rainfall climatology of stronger tropical cyclone events. The rainfall model developed herein was then coupled with state-of-the-art probabilistic tropical cyclone models and future projected climate change scenarios, allowing for the concomitant characterization of tropical cyclone hazards (wind speed, rain rate, and storm size) and the assessment of possible changes in the tropical cyclone hazards in a future climate state. In results obtained from tropical cyclone simulations performed herein under a postulated future climate scenario, in which no technology or policies have been implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, tropical cyclones are projected to intensify. The intensification seen in the simulation results is accompanied by a reduction in size, meaning the magnitude of the extreme wind and rainfall hazards are projected to increase, whereas the affected area is projected to decrease. Additionally, this simulated intensification implies events that are considered extreme in the current climate will occur more frequently in the future climate scenario, paving the way for possible exceedance of critical design values.

While the current state-of-the-art PV systems make this possible for seated individuals within the occupied zone, it is envisaged that flexible PV systems, extending the range of application within the dynamic movements of individuals in an air-conditioned zone, may be a reality in the near future. The ability of P V systems to enhance thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) and the energy savings that would result were examined under the hot and humid tropical conditions of Singapore. The experimental design consisted of 17 different environmental conditions, characterized by a combination of room ambient temperature (23 degrees C and 26 degrees C), PV air temperature (20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, and 26 degrees C), and the PV airflow rate (7, 11, and 15 L/s per person). The experimental design also included a reference condition with the primary background air-conditioning system operating under the same conditions but without PV air. Eleven human subjects took part in all the experiments, and a detailed questionnaire was employed to solicit their subjective responses during each exposure. Air velocity, air temperature, and ventilation effectiveness were measured in the immediate breathing zone of each occupant. The results indicate that the use of a secondary PV system in conjunction with a primary air-conditioning system not only enhances thermal comfort and IAQ acceptability but can reduce energy consumption by 15-30%. PV systems can improve ventilation effectiveness at the immediate breathing zone by up to 50% more than can be obtained with mixing ventilation (MV) alone, and P V tends to lower the average temperature of inhaled air in the breathing zone by 2-5 degrees C, enhancing perceived air quality. PV temperature and PV flow rate were found to be more critical than ambient temperature for occupants' thermal comfort and the perceived air quality of inhaled air.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Singapore 117548, Singapore; Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Engn Mech, Lyngby, Denmark",National University of Singapore; Technical University of Denmark,"Sekhar, SC (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Bldg, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",,"THAM, Kwok Wai/B-6541-2009; Sekhar, Chandra/F-3253-2017","THAM, Kwok Wai/0000-0002-2957-1152; Melikov, Arsen Krikor/0000-0003-0200-6046; Sekhar, Chandra/0000-0002-0814-8662; Cheong, David/0000-0001-7680-4281",,,,,25,73,74,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1078-9669,,,HVAC&R RES,HVAC&R Res.,OCT,2005,4,,,,603,620,,10.1080/10789669.2005.10391157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10789669.2005.10391157,,,18,"Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,971AC,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000232352500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study of such adaptative capacities is central to understanding the climate and environmental changes that occurred during the Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition, at around 1.2 Ma, when the persistence of subtropical ecosystems in Europe came to an end, and several reptile and tree taxa were extirpated. The SE Spain sites in the Guadix-Baza Basin offer an exceptional opportunity for studying this change, in addition to the significant findings made in this area in the field of human evolution. We have analysed the body size of the most well-represented amphibian species in the sites, the Iberian waterfrog, Pelophylax perezi. In order to reconstruct past body sizes from fossil samples, a regression model from current osteological collections has been generated. Also, diversity of the herpetofauna community was studied at different levels as richness or species number. Finally, to study the relationships between body size, richness, climate and productivity, OLS regression models and Pearson correlations were applied. Also for this purpose, a productivity indicator was designed based on the addition of the two most productive ecosystems from previous habitat reconstruction. Amphibian body size appears to be negatively associated with primary productivity, reaching minimum values during the interglacial stages, when species richness increased. In contrast, during glacial periods characterised by greater aridity and fewer resources, amphibian body size increased while species richness decreased. Main explanations proposed to justify this pattern are the water-availability hypothesis and a trade-off between somatic growth and reproductive opportunities for females. The study of herpetofaunal diversity shows a clear correlation to regional plant diversity and primary productivity. The results of this work indicate that species richness and amphibian body size are valuable proxies that can complement current environmental and climate reconstruction methods.","[Martinez-Monzon, Almudena; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian; Fagoaga, Ana; Agusti, Jordi; Barsky, Deborah; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social, IPHES CERCA, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Martinez-Monzon, Almudena; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian; Fagoaga, Ana; Agusti, Jordi; Barsky, Deborah; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Fagoaga, Ana] Univ Valencia, Area Palaeontol, PVC GIUV Palaeontol Cenozo Vertebrates Res Grp, Dr Moliner 50, E-46100 Valencia, Spain; [Fagoaga, Ana] Museu Valencia Hist Nat, POB 8460, E-46018 Valencia, Spain; [Oms, Oriol] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencies, Dept Geol, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Agusti, Jordi] Inst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats ICREA, Pg Lluis Companys 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain; [Solano-Garcia, Jose] Univ Seville, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, Maria de Padilla S-N, Seville 41004, Spain; [Manuel Jimenez-Arenas, Juan] Univ Granada, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Dept Prehist & Arqueol, Campus Univ Cartuja, Granada 18011, Spain; [Manuel Jimenez-Arenas, Juan] Univ Granada, Inst Univ La Paz & Conflictos, C Rector Lopez Argueta S-N, Granada 18011, Spain",ICREA; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Valencia; Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA; University of Sevilla; University of Granada; University of Granada,"Martinez-Monzon, A (corresponding author), Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social, IPHES CERCA, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV,Edifici W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain.",amartinez@iphes.cat; afagoaga@iphes.cat; joseporiol.oms@uab.es; jordi.agusti@icrea.cat; dbarsky@iphes.cat; jgsolano@us.es; jumajia@ugr.es; hablain@iphes.cat,,"Martinez-Monzon, Almudena/0000-0001-5120-9478; Barsky, Deborah/0000-0002-4921-0389; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian/0000-0002-7877-3332","Consejeria de Cultura, Junta de Andalucia [BC.03.032/17]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL 2016-80000-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2017SGR-859, 2017SGR-1666]; Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR); Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya [2021 FI_B2 00207]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PRE2020-094482, CEX2019-000945-M-20-1]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence [CEX2019-000945M]","Consejeria de Cultura, Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR)(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the Maria de Maeztu program for Units of Excellence(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN))","This publication has been authorised by the Consejeria de Cultura, Junta de Andalucia (Andalusian Ministry of Culture, Spain).

Here, the recent set of temperature reconstructions at the continental-scale generated by the PAGES 2k project and a collection of state-of-the-art model simulations driven by realistic external forcings are jointly analysed. The first aim is to estimate the consistency between model results and reconstructions for each continental-scale region over the time and frequency domains. Secondly, the links between regions are investigated to determine whether reconstructed global-scale covariability patterns are similar to those identified in model simulations. The third aim is to assess the role of external forcings in the observed temperature variations. From a large set of analyses, we conclude that models are in relatively good agreement with temperature reconstructions for Northern Hemisphere regions, particularly in the Arctic. This is likely due to the relatively large amplitude of the externally forced response across northern and high-latitude regions, which results in a clearly detectable signature in both reconstructions and simulations. Conversely, models disagree strongly with the reconstructions in the Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, the simulations are more regionally coherent than the reconstructions, perhaps due to an underestimation of the magnitude of internal variability in models or to an overestimation of the response to the external forcing in the Southern Hemisphere. Part of the disagreement might also reflect large uncertainties in the reconstructions, specifically in some Southern Hemisphere regions, which are based on fewer palaeoclimate records than in the Northern Hemisphere.","[Bothe, O.; Jungclaus, J.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Evans, M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Evans, M.] Univ Maryland, ESSIC, Baltimore, MD USA; [Fernandez Donado, L.; Gonzalez-Rouco, J.

Here, we consider the megaclimate regime(2) at scales >= 1 million years (Myr). We focus on determining the domains of 'wandering' stochastic Earth system processes ('Court Jester'(3)) and stabilizing biotic interactions that induce diversity dependence of fluctuations in macroevolutionary rates ('Red Queen'(4)). Using state-of-the-art multiscale Haar and cross-Haar fluctuation analyses, we analysed the global genus-level Phanerozoic marine animal Paleobiology Database record of extinction rates (E), origination rates (O) and diversity (D) as well as sea water palaeotemperatures (T). Over the entire observed range from several million years to several hundred million years, we found that the fluctuations of T, E and O showed time-scaling behaviour. The megaclimate was characterized by positive scaling exponents-it is therefore apparently unstable. E and O are also scaling but with negative exponents-stable behaviour that is biotically mediated. For D, there were two regimes with a crossover at critical timescale Delta(trans) approximate to 40 Myr. For shorter timescales, D exhibited nearly the same positive scaling as the megaclimate palaeotemperatures, whereas for longer timescales it tracks the scaling of macroevolutionary rates. At scales of at least Delta(trans) there is onset of diversity dependence of E and O, probably enabled by mixing and synchronization (globalization) of the biota by geodispersal ('Geo-Red Queen').","[Spiridonov, Andrej] Vilnius Univ, Dept Geol & Mineral, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Lovejoy, Shaun] McGill Univ, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Vilnius University; McGill University,"Spiridonov, A (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ, Dept Geol & Mineral, Vilnius, Lithuania.;Lovejoy, S (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Phys, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",andrej.spiridonov@gf.vu.lt; lovejoy@physics.mcgill.ca,"Lovejoy, Shaun/E-8019-2011","Lovejoy, Shaun/0000-0002-9367-3137; Spiridonov, Andrej/0000-0002-8773-5629",National Science and Engineering Council;  [S-MIP-21-9],National Science and Engineering Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); ,We thank A.

We have investigated the predictive skill of initialized hindcast simulations performed with three state-of-the-art climate prediction models within the CMIP5-framework, focusing on sea surface temperature (SST) in the Nordic Seas and Barents Sea, but also on sea ice extent, and the subpolar North Atlantic upstream. The hindcasts are compared with observation-based SST for the period 1961-2010. All models have significant predictive skill in specific regions at certain lead times. However, among the three models there is little consistency concerning which regions that display predictive skill and at what lead times. For instance, in the eastern Nordic Seas, only one model has significant skill in predicting observed SST variability at longer lead times (7-10 years). This region is of particular promise in terms of predictability, as observed thermohaline anomalies progress from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Fram Strait within the time frame of a couple of years. In the same model, predictive skill appears to move northward along a similar route as forecast time progresses. We attribute this to the northward advection of SST anomalies, contributing to skill at longer lead times in the eastern Nordic Seas. The skill at these lead times in particular beats that of persistence forecast, again indicating the potential role of ocean circulation as a source for skill. Furthermore, we discuss possible explanations for the difference in skill among models, such as different model resolutions, initialization techniques, and model climatologies and variance.","[Langehaug, H.

Warming and changes in nutrient supply may alter the ecological niche of nitrogen-fixing organisms, or 'diazotrophs', however, impacts of warming on diazotroph physiology may also be important. Lab-based studies reveal that warming increases the nitrogen fixation-specific elemental use efficiency (EUE) of two prevalent marine diazotrophs, Crocosphaera and Trichodesmium, thus reducing their requirements for the limiting nutrients iron and phosphorus. Here, we coupled a new diazotroph model based upon observed diazotroph energetics of growth and resource limitation to a state-of-the-art global model of phytoplankton physiology and ocean biogeochemistry. Our model is able to address the integrated response of nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera to warming under the IPCC high emission RCP8.5 scenario for the first time. Our results project a global decline in nitrogen fixation over the coming century. However, the regional response of nitrogen fixation to climate change is modulated by the diazotroph-specific thermal performance curves and EUE, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, which shapes global trends. Spatially, the response of both diazotrophs is similar with expansion towards higher latitudes and reduced rates of nitrogen fixation in the lower latitudes. Overall, 95%-97% of the nitrogen fixation climate signal can be attributed to the combined effect of temperature on the niche and physiology of marine diazotrophs, with decreases being associated with a reduced niche and increases resulting due to a combination of expanding niche and temperature driven changes to EUE. Climate change impacts on both the niche and physiology of marine diazotrophs interact to shape patterns of marine nitrogen fixation, which will have important implications for ocean productivity in the future.","[Wrightson, Lewis; Mahaffey, Claire; Tagliabue, Alessandro] Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Yang, Nina; Hutchins, David A.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Liverpool; University of Southern California,"Wrightson, L (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Earth Ocean & Ecol Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",lewis.wrightson@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Tagliabue, Alessandro/0000-0002-3572-3634; Wrightson, Lewis/0000-0001-6962-4709; Hutchins, David/0000-0002-6637-756X","H2020 European Research Council [724289]; National Science Foundation [OCE 1851222, OCE 2149837]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/L002469/1]",H2020 European Research Council; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 724289; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: OCE 1851222 and OCE 2149837; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: NE/L002469/1",,63,0,0,30,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

As a result, many of these residential buildings are at risk of overheating and require careful implementation of passive cooling design systems when retrofitting. This study reviews the overheating risk and energy effectiveness of six passive design strategies tested and implemented in an innovative terraced house located in southeast London during the long-term heatwaves experienced in both the UK and continental Europe in the summer of 2018. A quantitative research methodology is employed based on an extensive monitoring campaign conducted to measure environmental conditions, including indoor air temperature, relative humidity and CO2 of each occupied space in a prototype base-case building. In the subsequent phase of the research, retrofit strategies were investigated by modelling and simulation using the Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) software suite for data validation. The preliminary results of the modelling and simulation confirmed the survey findings of high levels of occupant discomfort and relatively high cooling loads. The internal operating temperatures of the simulated rooms remained high throughout the day and night during the long-term heatwaves, ranging from a minimum of 24.7 degrees C to a maximum of 32.1 degrees C. The results highlight significant deviations in the estimated energy consumption of the base-case building as well as in the energetic and environmental indexes of the passive cooling design strategies. The study will contribute to the strategic design of retrofit interventions to effectively reduce cooling energy consumption by considering occupants' thermal comfort, thermal adaptation and energy use.","[Ozarisoy, B.] Univ East London UEL, Grad Sch, Sch Architecture Comp & Engn, London E16 2RD, England",,"Ozarisoy, B (corresponding author), Univ East London UEL, Grad Sch, Sch Architecture Comp & Engn, London E16 2RD, England.",ozarisoybertug@gmail.com,"Ozarisoy, Dr. Bertug/GLU-2068-2022","Ozarisoy, Dr. Bertug/0000-0002-9005-4357","Graduate School at the University of East London (UEL), United Kingdom","Graduate School at the University of East London (UEL), United Kingdom","The author (Mr. Bertug Ozarisoy) is a fully self-funded PhD Researcher/Student at the Graduate School -School of Architecture, Computing & Engineering at the University of East London (UEL), United Kingdom.

Time series of monthly temperature and precipitation were evaluated because of their importance for climate studies and because they represent two important types of statistics (additive and multiplicative). The algorithms were validated against a realistic benchmark dataset. The benchmark contains real inhomogeneous data as well as simulated data with inserted inhomogeneities. Random independent break-type inhomogeneities with normally distributed breakpoint sizes were added to the simulated datasets. To approximate real world conditions, breaks were introduced that occur simultaneously in multiple station series within a simulated network of station data. The simulated time series also contained outliers, missing data periods and local station trends. Further, a stochastic nonlinear global (network-wide) trend was added. Participants provided 25 separate homogenized contributions as part of the blind study. After the deadline at which details of the imposed inhomogeneities were revealed, 22 additional solutions were submitted. These homogenized datasets were assessed by a number of performance metrics including (i) the centered root mean square error relative to the true homogeneous value at various averaging scales, (ii) the error in linear trend estimates and (iii) traditional contingency skill scores. The metrics were computed both using the individual station series as well as the network average regional series. The performance of the contributions depends significantly on the error metric considered. Contingency scores by themselves are not very informative. Although relative homogenization algorithms typically improve the homogeneity of temperature data, only the best ones improve precipitation data. Training the users on homogenization software was found to be very important. Moreover, state-of-the-art relative homogenization algorithms developed to work with an inhomogeneous reference are shown to perform best. The study showed that automatic algorithms can perform as well as manual ones.","[Venema, V. K.

The design of such control schemes relies on a thermal model of the building to predict indoor temperature. The model should be sufficiently accurate to describe building dynamics but simple enough to remain optimal for control purposes. This paper proposes a methodology to identify thermal RC networks to model building thermal dynamics of a residential buildings located in humid and rainy climates, a topic not widely covered in current literature. The candidate models for the methodology are determined through a parameter dispersion study, which consists of training the models multiple times and checking if the parameters converge to a single value regardless of their initial value. Then the effect of the training dataset characteristics on model performance is studied. The methodology is established and then tested in a residential case study in Panama from these conclusions. Results show that a linear model with few parameters and trained with only 10 days of data can successfully represent a system with prominent nonlinear phenomena. The model with the best performance during active operation has a validation root mean square error of 0.36 & DEG;C, which is satisfactory for controller design purposes. The model is then used to tune a proportional integral derivative controller, successfully employed to maintain the desired indoor temperature. Using the identified model to calibrate the controller avoids tedious trial and error procedures.","[Rivera, Ana K.; Sanchez, Josue; Chen Austin, Miguel] Univ Tecnol Panama, Fac Mech Engn, Res Grp Energy & Comft Bioclimat Bldg ECEB, Ciudad Panama, Panama; [Rivera, Ana K.] Univ Tecnol Panama, Fac Elect Engn, Ciudad Panama, Panama; [Chen Austin, Miguel] Univ Tecnol Panama, Ctr Estudios Multidisciplinarios Ciencias Ingn & T, Ciudad Panama, Panama; [Chen Austin, Miguel] Sistema Nacl Invest SNI, Ciudad Panama, Panama",Universidad Tecnologica de Panama; Universidad Tecnologica de Panama; Universidad Tecnologica de Panama,"Austin, MC (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Panama, Fac Mech Engn, Res Grp Energy & Comft Bioclimat Bldg ECEB, Ciudad Panama, Panama.;Austin, MC (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Panama, Ctr Estudios Multidisciplinarios Ciencias Ingn & T, Ciudad Panama, Panama.;Austin, MC (corresponding author), Sistema Nacl Invest SNI, Ciudad Panama, Panama.",miguel.chen@utp.ac.pa,,"Chen Austin, Miguel/0000-0001-5766-6020; Rivera, Ana K./0000-0002-8633-6810","Panamanian Institution Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENACYT); Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI) [FID18-056, FIED19-R2-005]","Panamanian Institution Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENACYT); Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI)","This research was funded by a Panamanian Institution Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENACYT) https://www.senacyt.gob.pa/(accessed on 20 May 2022) within the projects FID18-056 and FIED19-R2-005, together with the Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI).",,42,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2297-3362,,FRONT BUILT ENVIRON,Front.

Potential future changes in the occurrence of circulation types are highly relevant for society. Classifying the highly dynamic atmospheric circulation into discrete classes of circulation types helps to categorize the linkages between atmospheric forcing and surface conditions (e.g. extreme events). Previous studies have revealed a high internal variability of projected changes of circulation types. Dealing with this high internal variability requires the employment of a single-model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) and an automated classification method, which can be applied to large climate data sets. One of the most established classifications in Europe are the 29 subjective circulation types called Grosswetterlagen by Hess & Brezowsky (HB circulation types). We developed, in the first analysis of its kind, an automated version of this subjective classification using deep learning. Our classifier reaches an overall accuracy of 41.1% on the test sets of nested cross-validation. It outperforms the state-of-the-art automatization of the HB circulation types in 20 of the 29 classes. We apply the deep learning classifier to the SMHI-LENS, a SMILE of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6, composed of 50 members of the EC-Earth3 model under the SSP37.0 scenario. For the analysis of future frequency changes of the 29 circulation types, we use the signal-to-noise ratio to discriminate the climate change signal from the noise of internal variability. Using a 5%-significance level, we find significant frequency changes in 69% of the circulation types when comparing the future (2071-2100) to a reference period (1991-2020).","[Mittermeier, M.; Ludwig, R.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Weigert, M.; Ruegamer, D.; Kuechenhoff, H.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Stat Consulting StaBLab, Dept Stat, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich,"Mittermeier, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany.",m.mittermeier@lmu.de,,"Weigert, Maximilian/0000-0003-4400-134X",Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01IS18036A],Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The work of M M is funded through the ClimEx project (www.climex-project.org) by the Bavarian State Ministry for the Environment and Consumer Protection, the work of M W and D R by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under Grant No. 01IS18036A.

It is a National preserved building built since Chulalongkorn University established. This antique building made of brick and mortar in Thai contemporary architectural style. With external corridor around building, it had been used as lecture rooms with good ventilation at the upper doors and windows. In the old days, the micro climate was mostly in comfort zone during morning and evening. Hundred years passed by, university micro climate was changed. The ambient temperature has been risen up about 10 degrees Celsius during peak time of the day. Therefore, air temperature is out of comfort zone. Furthermore, building use was changed from lecture room to library. Heat sources from computers, copy machine, especially halogen lamp had been installed during renovation last few years. Air condition systems, split type system, were installed in some reading areas. The condensing units make the outdoor air temperature raises and blows into the building. Thailand locates in hot humid climate which is too hot and too humid exceed human comfort zone most of the time. Therefore, library users feel extremely uncomforted for thermal, visual, and acoustics. The University policy indicates that the library hall should be natural ventilation. Then, the acoustics problems would be excluded. The research conducted with finding all thermal and visual factors. It was found that appliances are the internal heat sources, and poor illumination on working plane. The inside air temperature ranged 30 to 32 degree Celsius. The illuminate on working plane was 200 to 256 lux. Appliances were relocated with exhaust heat to the openings. All halogen lamps were replaced by LED. The illuminance was improved to 400 lux on working plane. The air temperature was reduced to 2 to 3 degree Celsius. After, internal heat sources were reduced, then seeking for cool sources. There are air conditioning rooms nearby with exhaust fans which still has low air temperature. Then, all exhaust cool air was used to bypass to the library hall. The inside air temperature, now, reach to comfort zone with low mean radiant temperature (MRT). This study showed the way to make historical building to reach comfort condition. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This subject is notable in developing countries, specifically when they are located in earthquake-prone areas. After extensive destruction due to such incidents, authorities are confronted with numerous economic, social, and environmental complications in the implementation of housing solutions. Temporary housing (TH) is a short-term solution enabling communities to return to their routine activities by providing a minimum level of housing requirement. To accelerate the recovery procedure, resources should be carefully managed and a sustainable plan concerning economic, social, and environmental complexities should be developed. Therefore, this paper investigates the shortcomings of the existing TH solutions and uses prior experiences to propose a sustainable TH solution for an extensive area of Iran with a hot-arid climatic condition. Accordingly, the result is a TH system using earthquake rubbles in modular gabion containers. It was found that such a method could increase the occupants comfort level up to 8.61% while reducing a project's carbon footprint compared with the existing solutions. The proposed system assists authorities in confronting disasters with a more sustainable TH plan.

It is shown that the surface climatology simulated by this model is strongly dependent upon the fraction of the grid square, mu, receiving precipitation. It is also shown that fundamentally different hydrological regimes (one runoff dominated, the other evaporation dominated) are obtained for the otherwise identical situations. It is argued that the new generation of land surface models which explicitly incorporate vegetation may have to be 're-tuned' if differences between large-scale and small-scale precipitation events are accommodated in AGCMs. If precipitation is always assumed to fall uniformly over the grid square, the precipitation intensity will generally be underestimated. This will lead to an overestimation of canopy interception and interception loss. Furthermore, too little precipitation will reach the soil surface, and therefore surface runoff and the soil moisture will be underestimated. With too much interception loss, and too little soil water (and soil evaporation) there will be a tendency to re-cycle precipitation back to the atmosphere too quickly, leading to the unrealistic simulation of surface-atmosphere interactions. These results, if reproduced within an AGCM, would invalidate previous simulations of the effects of changing the state of the land surface on the atmosphere.",,,"PITMAN, AJ (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV,SCH EARTH SCI,N RYDE 2109,AUSTRALIA.",,"Pitman, Andrew J/A-7353-2011","Pitman, Andrew J/0000-0003-0604-3274",,,,,15,2,2,0,4,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,31-Jan,1991,2-Jan,,,,121,134,,10.1007/BF00036052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036052,,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FE700,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1991FE70000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unlike the South Pacific and South Atlantic, the topography of Madagascar prevents, through the Mozambique Channel Trough, the direct transport of moisture from the Indian Ocean toward southern Africa that feeds the South Indian Ocean Convergence Zone (SICZ). Numerical experiments using regional climate models reveal that a flatter than actual topography over Madagascar results in a strengthening of the SICZ through anomalously high easterly moisture fluxes transported from the Indian Ocean and the Mozambique Channel. These in turn trigger a significant increase in precipitation over southern Africa extending from Mozambique to Angola and a decrease in rainfall over Madagascar. These results have important implications for the improvement of the representation of African rainfall mean state and variability, which has been identified as a persisting issue in different generations of state-of-the-art climate models. Plain Language Summary We show that the topography of Madagascar is essential to adequately simulate the atmospheric circulation and rainfall over southern Africa and the neighboring southwest Indian Ocean. By conducting a set of numerical experiments, we evaluate the role of Madagascar and its topography in shaping the regional climate. The underlying mechanism through which reduced topography over Madagascar leads to more moisture transported from the Indian Ocean to the African mainland is analyzed. The results also help explain the often observed dipole rainfall anomaly between Madagascar and the mainland and the tendencies for climate models to inadequately represent a realistic mean rainfall pattern over the region.

Various long-term continuous measurements are augmented by frequent focused research campaigns with state-of-the-art instrumentation, linking different classes of data and addressing significant gaps in scientific data availability for urban environments. Current activities seek to address research objectives related to the urban heat island, trace gas emissions, the influence of foehn on air quality, and the atmospheric distribution of trace gases and aerosols in a mountainous city. We present initial results from long-term operations and first highlights from two intensive operational phases, showing that 1) the exchange of greenhouse gas emissions is dominated by anthropogenic activities and is driven by location-specific venting of street canyon air; 2) foehn events significantly perturb the photostationary state indicative for an extensive and rapid airmass exchange of the valley atmosphere; 3) the temporal distribution of pollutants is often decoupled from their emissions and primarily modulated by mountain boundary layer dynamics; 4) we can detect a large number of volatile chemical products in the urban atmosphere, which can be used to fingerprint anthropogenic emission sources; and 5) the first urban carbonyl sulfide (COS) flux measurements point toward anthropogenic emission sources.","[Karl, Thomas; Gohm, Alexander; Rotach, Mathias W.; Ward, Helen C.; Graus, Martin; Haid, Maren; Tiefengraber, Martin; Lamprecht, Christian] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, Innsbruck, Austria; [Cede, Alexander; Kreuter, Axel] LuftBlick, Innsbruck, Austria; [Wohlfahrt, Georg; Hammerle, Albin] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Innsbruck, Austria; [Vergeiner, Johannes; Staudinger, Michael] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria; [Kreuter, Axel; Wagner, Jochen] Med Univ Innsbruck, Div Biomed Phys, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck; University of Innsbruck; Medical University of Innsbruck,"Karl, T (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Atmospher & Cryospher Sci, Innsbruck, Austria.",thomas.karl@uibk.ac.at,"Karl, Thomas/D-1891-2009; Wohlfahrt, Georg/D-2409-2009; Graus, Martin G/E-7546-2010; Lamprecht, Christian/S-2300-2019; Hammerle, Albin/N-4345-2016; Gohm, Alexander/N-7473-2019; Rotach, Mathias/E-9938-2018","Karl, Thomas/0000-0003-2869-9426; Wohlfahrt, Georg/0000-0003-3080-6702; Graus, Martin G/0000-0002-2025-9242; Hammerle, Albin/0000-0003-1963-5906; Gohm, Alexander/0000-0003-4505-585X; Kreuter, Axel/0000-0002-3029-2601; Wagner, Jochen Ernst/0000-0002-9912-0488; Rotach, Mathias/0000-0003-2283-309X","Hochschulraum-Strukturmittel (HRSM) - Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research; EC Seventh Framework Program (Marie Curie Reintegration Program, ALP-AIR) [334084]; Austrian National Science Fund (FWF) [P30600, P29746, P26931, P27176]; FWF Lise Meitner Programme [M2244-N32]","Hochschulraum-Strukturmittel (HRSM) - Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research; EC Seventh Framework Program (Marie Curie Reintegration Program, ALP-AIR); Austrian National Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); FWF Lise Meitner Programme","This work was primarily funded by the Hochschulraum-Strukturmittel (HRSM) funds sponsored by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (www.bmbwf.gv.at/), the EC Seventh Framework Program (Marie Curie Reintegration Program, ALP-AIR, Grant 334084), and partly by the Austrian National Science Fund (FWF) Grants P30600, P29746, P26931 and P27176, and the FWF Lise Meitner Programme (M2244-N32).",,109,13,13,8,33,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

In contemporary adaptation planning, building resilience is considered together with objectives such as sustainability, productivity and transformations. An adaptation planning process (termed water-sensitive city adaptation planning process (WSCapp)) may be used to incorporate flexibility or incremental flexible adaptation measures in a comprehensive adaptation strategy, such as when planning water-sensitive cities. This paper applies WSCapp in the context of adapting to urban flooding in Melbourne, Australia, which aspires to become a water-sensitive city. Application of WSCapp - through nine steps of analysis - has helped identify appropriate adaptation measures and economic adaptation pathways. In the case of Melbourne, of the three adaptation measures considered, the combination of rainwater tanks at the household level and the flood-proofing of households was found to be the most effective. WSCapp is fundamental for future work with urban planning and infrastructure consultants and can greatly benefit them with obtaining a more flexible and sustainable flood management response.","[Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Ashley, Richard M.; Gersonius, Berry; Pathirana, Assela; Zevenbergen, Chris] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar; Lowe, Roland; Ashley, Richard M.; Gersonius, Berry; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten; Pathirana, Assela; Zevenbergen, Chris] Cooperat Res Ctr Water Sensit Cities, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Lowe, Roland; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Environm Dept Environm Engn, Lyngby, Denmark",IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; Technical University of Denmark,"Radhakrishnan, M (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands.;Radhakrishnan, M (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr Water Sensit Cities, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",m.radhakrishnan@un-ihe.org,"Loewe, Roland/AAQ-2793-2020; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/J-7792-2012","Loewe, Roland/0000-0002-5549-5456; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten/0000-0002-6221-9505; Radhakrishnan, Mohanasundar/0000-0003-3785-7713","Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Water Sensitive Cities, an initiative of the Australian government; EPSRC [EP/I029346/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Water Sensitive Cities, an initiative of the Australian government(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This technical paper is an outcome of ongoing research funded by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Water Sensitive Cities, an initiative of the Australian government.

To make them usable for a model simulation, they have to be pre-processed and, traditionally, provided as input files at discrete model time steps. In this paper, we present an online approach, which produces a minimal number of input data read-in at the beginning of a simulation and which handles essential processing steps online during the simulation. For this purpose, a stand-alone Python package emiproc was developed, which projects the inventory data to the model grid and generates temporal and vertical scaling profiles for individual emission categories. The package is also able to produce offline emission files if desired. Furthermore, we outline the concept of the online emission module (written in Fortran 90) and demonstrate its implementation in two different atmospheric transport models: COSMO-GHG and COSMO-ART. Simulation results from both modeling systems show the equivalence of the online and offline procedure. While the model run time is very similar for both approaches, input size and pre-processing time are greatly reduced when online emissions are utilized.","[Jahn, Michael; Kuhlmann, Gerrit; Mu, Qing; Haussaire, Jean-Matthieu; Ochsner, David; Brunner, Dominik] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol Empa, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Osterried, Katherine] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Climate Syst Modelling C2SM, Zurich, Switzerland; [Clement, Valentin] Fed Off Meteorol & Climatol MeteoSwiss, Kloten, Switzerland; [Mu, Qing] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Div Climate Modelling & Air Pollut, Oslo, Norway; [Clement, Valentin] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology (EMPA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Norwegian Meteorological Institute; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Brunner, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol Empa, Dubendorf, Switzerland.",dominik.brunner@empa.ch,"Brunner, Dominik/GSI-5449-2022; Brunner, Dominik/P-9520-2019; Kuhlmann, Gerrit/E-9697-2016","Brunner, Dominik/0000-0002-4007-6902; Kuhlmann, Gerrit/0000-0002-7021-4712; Jahn, Michael/0000-0003-0886-8245",SMARTCARB - European Space Agency (ESA) [4000119599/16/NL/FF/mg]; CHE through the European Commission Horizon 2020 program [776186]; Swiss Data Science Center; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment,SMARTCARB - European Space Agency (ESA); CHE through the European Commission Horizon 2020 program; Swiss Data Science Center; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment,"This research has been supported by the following projects: SMARTCARB funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) under contract no. 4000119599/16/NL/FF/mg, CHE through the European Commission Horizon 2020 program under grant no. 776186, Carbosense4D funded by the Swiss Data Science Center, and Multiscale air pollution modeling funded by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment.",,39,8,8,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere has low surface reflectivity and therefore its albedo is particularly sensitive to cloud cover. In modern-day climates, mainly because of systematic deficiencies in cloud and albedo at mid-and high latitudes, too much solar radiation enters the ocean. Along with too little radiation absorbed at lower latitudes because of clouds that are too bright, unrealistically weak poleward transports of energy by both the ocean and atmosphere are generally simulated in the Southern Hemisphere. This implies too little baroclinic eddy development and deficient activity in storm tracks. However, projections into the future by coupled climate models indicate that the Southern Ocean features a robust and unique increase in albedo, related to clouds, in association with an intensification and poleward shift in storm tracks that is not observed at any other latitude. Such an increase in cloud may be untenable in nature, as it is likely precluded by the present-day ubiquitous cloud cover that models fail to capture. There is also a remarkably strong relationship between the projected changes in clouds and the simulated current-day cloud errors. The model equilibrium climate sensitivity is also significantly negatively correlated with the Southern Hemisphere energy errors, and only the more sensitive models are in the range of observations. As a result, questions loom large about how the Southern Hemisphere will actually change as global warming progresses, and a better simulation of the modern-day climate is an essential first step.","[Trenberth, Kevin E.; Fasullo, John T.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA,"Trenberth, KE (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",trenbert@ucar.edu,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Fasullo, John/H-4552-2019; Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012","Fasullo, John/0000-0003-1216-892X; Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000","NOAA CLIVAR; CCDD [NA07OAR4310051, NA06OAR4310145]",NOAA CLIVAR(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); CCDD,"This research is partially sponsored by the NOAA CLIVAR and CCDD programs under Grants NA07OAR4310051 and NA06OAR4310145.

As the climate changes, protected lands could provide increased resilience to coastal communities, yet climate change also poses a threat to the continued existence and healthy functioning of these ecosystems. The objectives of this research are to characterize the distribution and types of coastal protected lands in the eastern United States, estimate their exposure to sea level rise, evaluate the potential impact of this exposure on associated ecosystem services, and then discuss appropriate adaptation measures. For this, we construct an inventory of coastal protected lands in shoreline counties of US states along the Atlantic. We summarize their ownership and land cover and evaluate their exposure to a 3-foot (0.91 m) rise in sea level. We find substantial variation in the amount of lands protected in coastal shoreline counties, from a high of 34 percent in Florida to a low of 7 percent in Pennsylvania. Federal ownership is greatest in the South, whereas state ownership dominates in the Mid-Atlantic. Private groups own large shares of protected lands in Maine, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maryland. Moving south, dominant land covers in protected areas shift from forests to wetlands. We find that one quarter of protected lands in shoreline counties will be affected by 3 feet of sea level rise, with substantial heterogeneity in exposure across states and greater impacts in southern states. Almost 50 percent of federal lands and around 25 percent of state lands will be affected. While substantial proportions of estuarine wetlands and unconsolidated shore (beaches and dunes) are currently protected and provide key coastal ecosystem services, 95 and 91 percent of these protected systems, respectively, will be affected by 3 feet of sea level rise. We discuss the potential consequences and the associated reductions in ecosystem service provisioning from sea level rise in the context of current funding and adaptation planning for conservation. We find that some of the states facing the greatest challenges art those lacking plans and funding. The large heterogeneity in ownership, land covers, and funding across states suggests that adaptation policies for coastal protected lands will need to be tailored to the local context; a one-size fits-all approach is unlikely to be as effective.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of elevated DOM on a coastal pelagic food web from the coastal northern Baltic Sea, in a 32-day mesocosm experiment. In particular, the study addresses the response of bacterioplankton to differences in character and composition of supplied DOM. The supplied DOM differed in stoichiometry and quality and had pronounced effects on the recipient bacterioplankton, driving compositional changes in response to DOM type. The shifts in bacterioplankton community composition were especially driven by the proliferation of Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, and Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria populations. The DOM additions stimulated protease activity and a release of inorganic nutrients, suggesting that DOM was actively processed. However, no difference between DOM types was detected in these functions despite different community compositions. Extensive release of re-mineralized carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was associated with the bacterial processing, corresponding to 25-85% of the supplied DOM. The DOM additions had a negative effect on phytoplankton with decreased Chl a and biomass, particularly during the first half of the experiment. However, the accumulating nutrients likely stimulated phytoplankton biomass which was observed to increase towards the end of the experiment. This suggests that the nutrient access partially outweighed the negative effect of increased light attenuation by accumulating DOM. Taken together, our experimental data suggest that parts of the future elevated riverine DOM supply to the Baltic Sea will be efficiently mineralized by microbes. This will have consequences for bacterioplankton and phytoplankton community composition and function, and significantly affect nutrient biogeochemistry.","[Traving, Sachia J.; Riemann, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, Ctr Ocean Life, Helsingor, Denmark; [Rowe, Owen; Andersson, Agneta] Umea Univ, Umea Marine Sci Ctr, Hornefors, Sweden; [Rowe, Owen; Andersson, Agneta] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Jakobsen, Nina M.; Sorensen, Helle] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Lab Appl Stat, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dinasquet, Julie; Riemann, Lasse] Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, Helsingor, Denmark; [Stedmon, Colin A.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Rowe, Owen] Univ Helsinki, Dept Food & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland",University of Copenhagen; Umea University; Umea University; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Technical University of Denmark; University of Helsinki,"Riemann, L (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, Ctr Ocean Life, Helsingor, Denmark.;Riemann, L (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, Helsingor, Denmark.",lriemann@bio.ku.dk,"Stedmon, Colin Andrew/B-5841-2008; Traving, Sachia Jo/D-3206-2015; Jakobsen, Nina M./B-7360-2015; Riemann, Lasse/J-7091-2014","Stedmon, Colin Andrew/0000-0001-6642-9692; Traving, Sachia Jo/0000-0003-4638-3986; Jakobsen, Nina M./0000-0002-8623-7492; Riemann, Lasse/0000-0001-9207-2543",EU project MESOAQUA [228224]; Marine Strategic Environment initiative EcoChange - Ecosystems dynamics in the Baltic Sea in a climate change perspective (FORMAS); VKR Centre of Excellence in Ocean Life - Villum foundation; BONUS; joint Baltic Sea research and development program [Art 185]; European Union's Seventh Program; Villum Fonden [00007178] Funding Source: researchfish,EU project MESOAQUA; Marine Strategic Environment initiative EcoChange - Ecosystems dynamics in the Baltic Sea in a climate change perspective (FORMAS); VKR Centre of Excellence in Ocean Life - Villum foundation; BONUS; joint Baltic Sea research and development program; European Union's Seventh Program; Villum Fonden(Villum Fonden),"This project was funded by the EU project MESOAQUA (No. 228224), the Marine Strategic Environment initiative EcoChange - Ecosystems dynamics in the Baltic Sea in a climate change perspective (FORMAS), the VKR Centre of Excellence in Ocean Life funded by the Villum foundation, the BONUS BLUEPRINT and COCOA projects that have received funding from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development program (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union's Seventh Program for research, technological development and demonstration, and The Danish Council for Strategic Research.",,80,50,55,9,102,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

HOMER has been constructed exploiting the best characteristics of some other state-of-the-art homogenization methods, i.e., PRODIGE, ACMANT, CLIMATOL, and the recently developed joint-segmentation method (cghseg). HOMER is based on the methodology of optimal segmentation with dynamic programing, the application of a network-wide two-factor model both for detection and correction, and some new techniques in the coordination of detection processes from multiannual to monthly scales. HOMER also includes a tool to assess trend biases in urban temperature series (UBRIS). HOMER's approach to the final homogenization results is iterative. HOMER is an interactive method, that takes advantage of metadata. A practical application of HOMER is presented on temperature series of Wien, Austria and its surroundings.","[Mestre, Olivier; Dubuisson, Brigitte] Meteo France, Direct Prod, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Domonkos, Peter] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Ctr Climate Change, Tortosa 43500, Spain; [Picard, Franck] UCB Lyon 1, UMR 5558, Villeurbanne, France; [Auer, Ingeborg; Boehm, Reinhard] Zentralanstalt Meteorol & Geodynam, Vienna, Austria; [Robin, Stephane; Lebarbier, Emilie] AgroParisTech, UMR 518, Paris, France; [Robin, Stephane; Lebarbier, Emilie] INRA, UMR 518, Paris, France; [Aguilar, Enric] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Ctr Climate Change, Tarragona, Spain; [Guijarro, Jose] Agencia Estatal Meteorol, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Vertachnik, Gregor; Klancar, Matija] Environm Agcy Republ Slovenia, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Stepanek, Petr] Czech Hydrometeorol Inst, Brno, Czech Republic",Meteo France; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; VetAgro Sup; AgroParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET); Czech Hydrometeorological Institute,"Mestre, O (corresponding author), Meteo France, Direct Prod, 42 Ave Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse, France.",Olivier.Mestre@meteo.fr,"Aguilar, Enric/L-4971-2014; Domonkos, Peter/L-5257-2014; Stepanek, Petr/G-1614-2014; Guijarro, José A/L-3744-2014","Domonkos, Peter/0000-0002-3148-244X; Stepanek, Petr/0000-0001-8956-5590; Guijarro, José A/0000-0002-9527-9758; Robin, Stephane/0000-0003-1045-069X; Picard, Franck/0000-0001-8084-5481; Aguilar, Enric/0000-0002-8384-377X","European Union, through the COST Action [ES0601]","European Union, through the COST Action","HOMER has been developed with support of the European Union, through the COST Action ES0601 - Advances in Homogenization Methods of Climate Series: an Integrated Approach (HOME).",,28,136,138,0,22,HUNGARIAN METEOROLOGICAL SERVICE,BUDAPEST,"PO BOX 38, BUDAPEST, H-1525, HUNGARY",0324-6329,,,IDOJARAS,Idojaras,JAN-MAR,2013,1,,SI,,47,67,,,,,,21,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,109IT,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000316361000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

These developments generally lead to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding. This article focuses on systems to protect against this hazard, and presents a bibliographical analysis on methods and operational tools to strengthen their resilience. This analysis is carried out by considering that a system of protection is a component of the territory to which it provides protection and that it is therefore necessary to study in depth the relations between this system and the various components of the territory (the natural environment, the built environment and the social and institutional environment). Based on this hypothesis, the concepts of risk and resilience applied to floods are specified and the protection and adaptation strategies commonly used in recent decades are described. This retrospective on concepts and strategies leads us to structure the state-of-the-art analysis on methods and operational tools in relation to two issues: 1) understanding risks; 2) adapting and transforming protection systems. In each case, the use of the concept of resilience implies a clear distinction between systemic and analytical approaches. Finally, this bibliographical analysis reveals the need to revise the protection system concept in order to promote the integration of these systems in the territories. Accordingly, new methodological developments could be considered using ecosystem and socio-economic approaches.","[Igigabel, Marc] Cerema, Technopole Brest Iroise, Plouzane, France; [Diab, Youssef] Univ Gustave Eiffel, Lab Urba, Champs Sur Marne, France; [Yates, Marissa] St Venant Hydraul Lab, Chatou, France; [Yates, Marissa] Cerema, Chatou, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Igigabel, M (corresponding author), Cerema, Technopole Brest Iroise, Plouzane, France.",marc.igigabel@cerema.fr,,,,,,,205,0,0,5,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

This glacial period is typified by generally cold and dry conditions in the western Mediterranean region. Despite the relatively large number of pollen and speleothem studies of MIS 6 in this region, the number of MIS 6 archaeological sites is low. Lazaret cave, situated at 26 m a.s.l. in the city of Nice in southern France, contains an archaeological sequence (layers CII inf. to CIII) dated to MIS 6. We present a multi-method approach using the small-vertebrate assemblages (mainly rodents and herpetofauna) from the entire sequence to characterize the climate and the environment of the site. The Mutual Ecogeographic Range, the Bioclimatic Model andthe Quantified Ecology methods, as well as the Taxonomic Habitat Index, Climatograms and the Simpson Diversity Index were used to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions. The results suggest a generally cold climate with a relatively humid environment and a landscape dominated by deciduous temperate forests. The findings are consistent with the general trends reported from other proxies (large mammals, birds and marine gastropods) studied at Lazaret cave, other MIS 6 sites in the Mediterranean region with small vertebrate studies and the general trends shown by marine cores, terrestrial pollen sequences and speleothems from western Europe. Given the scarcity of data for MIS 6 archaeological sites, Lazaret cave constitutes an important site for our knowledge of the climate and the environment of this period.","[Manuel Lopez-Garcia, Juan; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian] Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV Edif W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Manuel Lopez-Garcia, Juan; Blain, Hugues-Alexandre; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Hist & Hist Art, Avinguda Catalunya 35, Tarragona 43002, Spain; [Cohen, Jessica; Desclaux, Emmanuel] Lab Prehist Lazaret, Nice, France; [Lebreton, Loic] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Musee Homme, MNHN CNRS UPVD, Dept Homme & Environm,UMR 7194,HNHP, Paris, France; [Montuire, Sophie] PSL Univ, EPHE, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Montuire, Sophie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, EPHE, CNRS, Biogeosci,UMR 6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Stewart, John R.] Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Desclaux, Emmanuel] Univ Cote dAzur, UMR CNRS 72 64, CEPAM, Pale St Jean dAngely, 25 Ave Francois Mitterrand, F-06300 Nice, France",Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Catalan Institute of Human Paleo-Ecology & Social Evolution (IPHES); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universite de Bourgogne; Bournemouth University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Lopez-Garcia, JM (corresponding author), Inst Catala Paleoecol Humana & Evolucio Social IP, Zona Educ 4,Campus Sescelades URV Edif W3, Tarragona 43007, Spain.",jmlopez@iphes.cat; hablain@iphes.cat; csanchezbandera@gmail.com; jessica.co@outlook.fr; loicleb@hotmail.com; Sophie.Montuire@u-bourgogne.fr; jstewart@bournemouth.ac.uk; isemmanuel.desclaux@gmail.com,"López-García, Juan Manuel/R-8565-2016","López-García, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-1605-9763; Sanchez-Bandera, Christian/0000-0002-7877-3332; Desclaux, Emmanuel/0000-0002-6565-9979","Catalonian Government [2017-SGR-836, 2017-SGR859]; Ramon y Cajal contract [RYC-2016-19386]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; DRAC PACA (French Ministry of Culture)","Catalonian Government; Ramon y Cajal contract(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); DRAC PACA (French Ministry of Culture)","This research was supported by the 2017-SGR-836 and 2017-SGR859 projects of the Catalonian Government.

Here we conduct a state-of-the-art estimate of the spatial-temporal variability of GHG emissions intensities for wheat, maize, and rice in China from 1949 to 2012 using an improved agricultural ecosystem model (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model-Agriculture Version 2.0) and meta-analysis covering 172 field-GHG emissions experiments. The results show that the GHG emissions intensities of these croplands from 1949 to 2012, on average, were 0.10-1.31 kg CO2-eq/kg, with a significant increase rate of 1.84-3.58 x 10(-3) kg CO2-eq kg(-1) year(-1). Nitrogen fertilizer was the dominant factor contributing to the increase in GHG emissions intensity in northern China and increased its impact in southern China in the 2000s. Increasing GHG emissions intensity implies that excessive fertilizer failed to markedly stimulate crop yield increase in China but still exacerbated soil GHG emissions. This study found that overfertilization of more than 60% was mainly located in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation systems in the North China Plain, the winter wheat-rice rotation systems in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and southwest China, and most of the double rice systems in the South. Our simulations suggest that roughly a one-third reduction in the current N fertilizer application level over these overfertilization regions would not significantly influence crop yield but decrease soil GHG emissions by 29.60%-32.50% and GHG emissions intensity by 0.13-0.25 kg CO2-eq/kg. This reduction is about 29% and 5% of total agricultural soil GHG emissions in China and the world, respectively. This study suggests that improving nitrogen use efficiency would be an effective strategy to mitigate GHG emissions and sustain China's food security.","[Zhang, Jingting; Wang, Xiaoke] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tian, Hanqin; Shi, Hao; Pan, Shufen] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Zhang, Jingfang] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Yang, Jia] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Mississippi State University,"Tian, HQ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36830 USA.",tianhan@auburn.edu,"Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012","Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091; Zhang, Jingting/0000-0001-5041-3629; Shi, Hao/0000-0001-8250-0567","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604702, 2018YFA0606001]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KFJSTSZDTP-0, SKLURE2017-1-6]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41961124006]; US National Science Foundation [1903722]; Andrew Carnegie Fellowship Award [G-F-19-56910]",National Key R&D Program of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Andrew Carnegie Fellowship Award,National Key R&D Program of China: 2017YFA0604702 and 2018YFA0606001; Chinese Academy of Sciences: KFJSTSZDTP-0 and SKLURE2017-1-6; National Natural Science Foundation of China: 41961124006; US National Science Foundation: 1903722; Andrew Carnegie Fellowship Award: G-F-19-56910,,114,19,25,78,377,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this study, spatial distributions and trends in thirty-seven hydro-climatic mean and extreme indices across Iran were analyzed based on the state-of-the-art reanalysis datasets (ERA5-Land and AgERA5) at the county level from 1986 to 2015 using several nonparametric approaches such as multiple modified Mann-Kendall statistical tests and Sen's Slope estimator. Their interannual oscillations were also examined using continuous wavelet transform to portray a complete picture of the temporal variability of the variables. The micro-scale of the reanalysis datasets enabled us to deal with the sparse distribution of weather stations in Iran, study various hydro-climatic variables that have received less attention, and subsequently provide a comprehensive, all-in-one reference for later policy actions and further studies. Analyzing diverse, intercorrelated variables provides a great opportunity to explore the driving forces of the temporal patterns. The results showed that trends in hydro-climatic mean and extreme indices highly depended on their geographical location and climate zones. The snow and the warm temperate climates encountered larger hydro-climatic changes compared to the arid and semi-arid climates zones. The most noticeable trends were found for temperature which significantly increased over all counties while drying trends were observed in precipitation, surface reservoir content, and runoff. Wind speed and surface albedo in most counties experienced upward and downward trends, respectively, whereas solar radiation, surface air pressure, and evaporation exhibited a high spatial variability. In terms of extreme events, Iran was faced with an increase in hot climate extremes and a decrease in cold and precipitation extremes. At last, the wavelet power spectrum analysis demonstrated the annual and seasonal dominant periods for precipitation and an annual dominant period for temperature, and there were were significant periodic variations at 2-3 years for hot and cold spell durations and intensity-based precipitation index and 4-6 years for consecutive dry and wet days. The annual fluctuation of precipitation reduced over the study period, but that of temperature remained almost constant.","[Malaekeh, SayedMorteza; Safaie, Ammar] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Azadi Ave, Tehran, Iran; [Shiva, Layla] Tehran Inst Adv Studies, Dept Econom, Mollasadra Blvd, Tehran, Iran; [Tabari, Hossein] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Leuven, Belgium",Sharif University of Technology; KU Leuven,"Safaie, A (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Azadi Ave, Tehran, Iran.",s.malaekeh94@sharif.edu; asafaie@sharif.edu; l.shiva@teias.institute; hossein.tabari@kuleuven.be,"Tabari, Hossein/E-2911-2015","Tabari, Hossein/0000-0003-2052-4541; Malaekeh, SayedMorteza/0000-0003-2794-9374; Safaie, Ammar/0000-0003-3327-2224",Research Office of Sharif University of Technology,Research Office of Sharif University of Technology,"The authors wish to express their thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that improved the quality of the paper.

Recently, it has been argued that this increase in anthropogenic aerosols can be linked to a decrease in wet removal associated with reduced precipitation(2), but the mechanisms remain uncertain. Here, using a state-of-the-art climate model (the Community Atmosphere Model version 5), we expand on this notion to demonstrate that the enhanced aerosol burden and hydrological changes are related to a robust climate change phenomenon-the land-sea warming contrast(3,4). Enhanced land warming is associated with continental reductions in lower-tropospheric humidity that drive decreases in low clouds-particularly large scale (stratus) clouds-which, in turn, lead to reduced large-scale precipitation and aerosol wet removal. Idealized model simulations further show that muting the land-sea warming contrast weakens these hydrological changes, thereby suppressing the aerosol increase. Moreover, idealized simulations that only feature land warming yield enhanced continental aridity and an increase in aerosol burden. Thus, unless anthropogenic emission reductions occur, our results add confidence that a warmer world will be associated with enhanced aerosol pollution.","[Allen, Robert J.; Hassan, Taufiq] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Randles, Cynthia A.] ExxonMobil Res & Engn Co, Annandale, NJ USA; [Su, Hui] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Exxon Mobil Corporation; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Allen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",rjallen@ucr.edu,,"Su, Hui/0000-0003-1265-9702; Allen, Robert/0000-0003-1616-9719; Hassan Mozumder, Mohammad Taufiq/0000-0003-2361-6361",Fellowships and Internships in Extremely Large Data Sets programme - NASA MUREP Institutional Research Opportunity; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company; NASA ACMAP programme,Fellowships and Internships in Extremely Large Data Sets programme - NASA MUREP Institutional Research Opportunity; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company(Exxon Mobil Corporation); NASA ACMAP programme,"T.H. is supported in part by the Fellowships and Internships in Extremely Large Data Sets programme, which is funded by the NASA MUREP Institutional Research Opportunity and developed by the University of California, Riverside and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Based on the close connection between the interannual variability and climatological states, the distinctive relation between the intermodel diversity of the interannual variability and that of the basic state is found. Based on this relation, the simulated interannual variabilities can be improved, by correcting their climatological bias. To test this methodology, the dominant intermodel difference in precipitation responses during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENS 0) is investigated, and its relationship with climatological state. It is found that the dominant intermodel diversity of the ENSO precipitation in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is associated with the zonal shift of the positive precipitation center during El Nino. This dominant intermodel difference is significantly correlated with the basic states. The models with wetter (dryer) climatology than the climatology of the multimodel ensemble (MME) over the central Pacific tend to shift positive ENSO precipitation anomalies to the east (west). Based on the model's systematic errors in atmospheric ENSO response and bias, the models with better climatological state tend to simulate more realistic atmospheric ENSO responses. Therefore, the statistical method to correct the ENSO response mostly improves the ENSO response. After the statistical correction, simulating quality of the MME ENSO precipitation is distinctively improved. These results provide a possibility that the present methodology can be also applied to improving climate projection and seasonal climate prediction.","[Ham, Yoo-Geun] Chonnam Natl Univ, Fac Earth Syst & Environm Sci, Kwangju, South Korea; [Kug, Jong-Seong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Pohang, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kug, JS (corresponding author), POSTEC, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 790784, South Korea.",jskug1@gmail.com,,"KUG, JONG-SEONG/0000-0003-2251-2579",Chonnam National University,Chonnam National University,"This study is supported by Chonnam National University, 2013.",,66,45,45,0,22,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

There is an ongoing debate among ecologists on the value of exotic vegetation to ecosystem resilience and integrity, with authors arguing that in order for ecosystems to survive in future climates, exotic species with similar conditions in their current range must be considered. Others deem biodiversity vital for ecosystem functions and services, stating that most biodiversity losses are man-induced and should be addressed through the enhancement of native communities. Through a literature review, we confronted the arguments used in this debate, with the aim of conducting a comprehensive analysis of the potential of exotic and native vegetation in different aspects of the vegetation's performance. The outcomes are important for the assessment of vegetation assemblages within UGS projects. Despite the strong arguments regarding their performative and adaptive capacity, we conclude that exotics pose significant ecological risks and have multiple negative impacts on ecosystem processes. Natives not only present high adaptive capacity, but also provide additional benefits for biodiversity, ecosystem integrity, and for people. In a broader framework, the literature demonstrates a preference for the use of native species in most situations.","[de Carvalho, Catarina Archer; Raposo, Mauro; Pinto-Gomes, Carlos; Matos, Rute] Univ Evora, Dept Paisagem Ambiente & Ordenamento, P-7000671 Evora, Portugal; [de Carvalho, Catarina Archer; Matos, Rute] Univ Evora, CHAIA Ctr Hist Arte & Invest Artist, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal; [Raposo, Mauro; Pinto-Gomes, Carlos] Univ Evora, MED Mediterranean Inst Agr Environm & Dev, P-7006554 Evora, Portugal; [Pinto-Gomes, Carlos] Univ Evora, ICT Inst Ciencias Terra, Rua Romao Ramalho,59, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal",University of Evora; University of Evora; University of Evora; University of Evora,"Pinto-Gomes, C (corresponding author), Univ Evora, Dept Paisagem Ambiente & Ordenamento, P-7000671 Evora, Portugal.;Pinto-Gomes, C (corresponding author), Univ Evora, MED Mediterranean Inst Agr Environm & Dev, P-7006554 Evora, Portugal.;Pinto-Gomes, C (corresponding author), Univ Evora, ICT Inst Ciencias Terra, Rua Romao Ramalho,59, P-7002554 Evora, Portugal.",d11461@alunos.uevora.pt; mraposo@uevora.pt; cpgomes@uevora.pt; rsm@uevora.pt,"Raposo, Mauro/AAD-3918-2021","Raposo, Mauro/0000-0002-9614-6180; Pinto Gomes, Carlos Jose/0000-0001-9452-6449","Center for the History of Art and Artistic Research (CHAIA/UID) [RG-112-400586, UID/00112/2020/FCT]",Center for the History of Art and Artistic Research (CHAIA/UID),We thank the Landscape Research Group (Ref.

Natural-history images more generally exhibit common styles in the world settled and dominated by Europeans. Apparently dramatic differences in the local settings of the artists produced only trivial variations in representing nature pictorially, in just the way that astronomy and physics in the European colonies and spheres of influence departed hardly at all from European practice. The overwhelming strength of disciplinary norms, in science and in art, is the standard explanation for this circumstance. An alternative explanation from social history is proposed. It centers on the hypothesis of a homology between households in colonial settings and in Europe. The alternative explanation implies that both the observatory and the artist's workshop were insensitive to superstructural variation in costume and architecture, as well as variation in climate and cuisine. The hypothesis behind the alternative explanation, designated by the term complementarity, derives directly from the postmodernist dictum that ideas are extrusions of social interactions. Nevertheless, just as the strength of disciplinary norms is unresolved in postmodernist doctrine, so complementarity directly challenges the postmodernist predilection for affirming the distinctiveness of colonial cultures.","Western Michigan Univ, Dept Hist, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Western Michigan University,"Pyenson, L (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Dept Hist, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",lewis.py-enson@wmich.edu,,,"Dudley Observatory in Schenectady, New York","Dudley Observatory in Schenectady, New York","A version of this text was read at the Bicentennial Colloquium of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, August 28-29, 2008, Science and Empire Dutch 'Colonial' Science around 1800 in Comparative Perspective: Globalization of the Circulation of Knowledge before Humboldt? and also at the School of Communication, Simon Fraser University, on February 20, 2009.

The latest mid-Holocene simulations are a palaeoclimate entry card for the Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP4) component of the current phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) - hereafter referred to as PMIP4-CMIP6. Here we provide an initial analysis and evaluation of the results of the experiment for the mid-Holocene. We show that state-of-the-art models produce climate changes that are broadly consistent with theory and observations, including increased summer warming of the Northern Hemisphere and associated shifts in tropical rainfall. Many features of the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations were present in the previous generation (PMIP3-CMIP5) of simulations. The PMIP4-CMIP6 ensemble for the mid-Holocene has a global mean temperature change of -0.3 K, which is -0.2K cooler than the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations predominantly as a result of the prescription of realistic greenhouse gas concentrations in PMIP4-CMIP6. Biases in the magnitude and the sign of regional responses identified in PMIP3-CMIP5, such as the amplification of the northern African monsoon, precipitation changes over Europe, and simulated aridity in mid-Eurasia, are still present in the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations. Despite these issues, PMIP4-CMIP6 and the mid-Holocene provide an opportunity both for quantitative evaluation and derivation of emergent constraints on the hydrological cycle, feedback strength, and potentially climate sensitivity.","[Brierley, Chris M.; Zhao, Anni; Thornalley, David J.

Future coastal inundation is mainly influenced by storm surge and rising sea level. The sea level rises projected by the A1FI, A1B and B1 emissions scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are considered. The effects of economic and population growth are accounted for by three urban development scenarios: (a) business as usual, (b) urban consolidation and (c) regional development. The adaptation policy actions investigated include a 'protect' stance (involving the construction of seawalls), an 'accommodate' stance that mandates raising house floors to a certain height (e.g. at heights of 100-year events) and an 'avoid' stance that limits new developments in hazardous areas. Policy stances classified as reactive (i.e. action taken after damage being incurred) and anticipatory (i.e. action taken anticipating what will happen) are developed for asset investment choices. In general, adaptation costs are an order of magnitude lower than benefits gained from avoided damages. The results highlight that adaptation action for coastal inundation has a no-regrets character and provides a strong case for reform to ensure that Australia-wide adaptation opportunities are realised.","[Wang, Chi-Hsiang; Khoo, Yong Bing; Wang, Xiaoming] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, POB 56,37 Graham Rd, Highett, Vic 3190, Australia; [Baynes, Tim] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [McFallan, Stephen; Quezada, George] CSIRO, Land & Water Flagship, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [West, Jim; Herr, Alexander; Beaty, R.

Ice sheet models are particularly relevant for predicting the possible response of ice sheets to climate change. Recent observations suggest that ice dynamics could play a crucial role for the contribution of ice sheets to future sea level rise under global warming conditions, and the need for further research into the matter was explicitly stated in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this paper, we review the state of the art and current problems of ice sheet and glacier modelling. An outline of the underlying theory is given, and crucial processes (basal sliding, calving, interaction with the solid Earth) are discussed. We summarise recent progress in the development of ice sheet and glacier system models and their coupling to climate models, and point out directions for future work.","[Blatter, Heinz] ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Greve, Ralf] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Kita Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; [Abe-Ouchi, Ayako] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Hokkaido University; University of Tokyo,"Blatter, H (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",blatter@env.ethz.ch; greve@lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp; abeouchi@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/M-6359-2013; Greve, Ralf/G-2336-2010","Abe-Ouchi, Ayako/0000-0003-1745-5952; Greve, Ralf/0000-0002-1341-4777",,,,,130,20,21,2,45,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-3298,1573-0956,,SURV GEOPHYS,Surv.

Materials and methods A correlation and regression analysis was performed between sediment yield and over 40 environmental variables for 61 Spanish catchments. Variables were selected based on availability and expected relation with diverse soil erosion and sediment transport processes. For comparison, the Area Relief Temperature (ART) sediment delivery model was applied to the same catchments. Sediment yield estimates obtained from reservoir surveys were used for model calibration and validation. Results and discussion Catchment area, catchment perimeter, stream length, relief ratio, Modified Fournier Index, the RUSLE's R factor, and catchments percentage with poor vegetation cover showed highest correlations with sediment yield. Stepwise linear regression revealed that variables representing topography, climate, vegetation, lithology, and soil characteristics are required for the best prediction equation. Although calibration results were relatively good, validation showed that the models were unstable and not suitable for extrapolation to other catchments. Reasons for this unstable model performance include (1) lack of detail and quality of the data sources; (2) large variation in catchment characteristics; (3) insufficient representation of all relevant erosion and sediment transport processes; and (4) the presence of nonlinear relations between sediment yield and environmental variables. The nonlinear ART model performed relatively well but systematically overpredicted sediment yield. A model reflecting human impacts, including dams and conservation measures, is expected to provide better results. This, however, requires significantly more input data. Conclusions Although important insight is obtained into the relation between sediment yield and environmental factors, prediction of sediment yield at the catchment scale requires alternative approaches. More detailed information is required on land cover (change), and the effect of soil conservation measures. Validation of regression equations is a necessity, and better predictions are obtained by nonlinear models.","[de Vente, Joris] CSIC, EEZA, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Dept Desertificat & Geoecol, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [de Vente, Joris] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Verduyn, Rubia; Verstraeten, Gert; Vanmaercke, Matthias; Poesen, Jean] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Geog Div, GEO INST, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Zonas Aridas (EEZA); University of Aberdeen; KU Leuven,"de Vente, J (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Dept Desertificat & Geoecol, Carretera Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.",Joris@sustainable-ecosystems.org,"de Vente, Joris/C-1304-2012; Verstraeten, Gert/K-3305-2012","de Vente, Joris/0000-0001-7428-0621; Verstraeten, Gert/0000-0002-6529-7381; Vanmaercke, Matthias/0000-0002-2138-9073; POESEN, Jean/0000-0001-6218-8967",EC [037046],EC(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),The research described in this paper was conducted in the framework of the EC-DG RTD 6th Framework Research Programme (sub-priority 1.1.6.3)-Research on Desertification-project DESIRE (037046): Desertification Mitigation and Remediation of Land-a global approach for local solutions.

Due to this fact, there are only a few and old studies about the climate of the region being the improvement of the state of the Art of the rainfall climatology and its variability, a hot point for the understanding of the tropical climate. The period without data occurs after the climate shift of the 70's, for which important changes in the global climate have been documented. For all these reasons, the reconstruction of the Angola precipitation timeseries is of great interest. Using the commonly used methodology of statistical downscaling, the 1979-2003 rainfall timeseries have been reconstructed for the rainy season, taking into account the available atmospheric information from the NCEP reanalysis and documented teleconnection indices with an important influence in Southern African continent. Also, new indices have been calculated on the basis of the teleconnections established with the available data and the analysis of the work done by other authors. The variability of the reconstructed precipitation has been characterized by calculating the principal modes of the anomalous rainfall and a comparison with a satellite-based rainfall data set has been also performed. The information obtained in this study is very useful and adds new insight for the improvement of the knowledge of the Angola climatology and its variability.","[Rodriguez-Fonseca, Belen; Adolfo Xavier, Joaquim] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Geofis & Meteorol, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Rodriguez-Fonseca, B (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Geofis & Meteorol, Madrid, Spain.",brfonsec@fis.ucm.es,"Rodriguez-Fonseca, Belen/I-8276-2017","Rodriguez-Fonseca, Belen/0000-0002-5261-7083",,,,,14,1,1,0,0,"UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",MADRID,"CIUDAD UNIV, OBISPO TREJO 3, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",0214-4557,1988-2440,,FIS TIERRA,Fis Tierra,,2009,,,,,191,205,,,,,,15,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geochemistry & Geophysics,V22TD,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000215043200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diverse authors have pointed out that this anthropocentric outlook is problematic, destructive, and neo-colonial. How might it be possible to approach a landscape, i.e., land itself, and all that lives on it, in a way that foregrounds the realities and risks of that site, without falling back on familiar humanistic and anthropocentric tropes? In this essay, I explore three recent artworks that each engage with a different landscape: Requiem for a Glacier by artist and composer Paul Walde (2013); the Urban Prairie designed by landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associes (2012); and The Boreal Poetry Garden by visual artist Marlene Creates (born 2005-). By analyzing these artists' and designers' creative strategies in relation to these landscapes, I delve into the question of ecological collaboration in each project, and explore the ways in which the non-human aspects of the landscape do, or do not, take centre stage. In so doing, this essay has a second aim: to explore the extent to which, in performing a didactic relationship with their sites, these three projects contribute to an activist and pedagogical ethos around climate change, habitat, and ecology.","[Hammond, Cynthia Imogen] Concordia Univ, Dept Art Hist, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Hammond, CI (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Art Hist, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",cynthia.hammond@concordia.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The author acknowledges with gratitude the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for supporting this research.,,55,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2021,10,,,,,,5729,10.3390/su13105729,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13105729,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ST6JQ,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000662547700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Just how reliable are these projections, given the complexity of the climate system? The early history of climate research provides insight into the understanding and science needed to answer this question. We examine the mathematical quantifications of planetary energy budget developed by Svante Arrhenius (18591927) and Guy Stewart Callendar (1898-1964) and construct an empirical approximation of the latter, which we show to be successful at retrospectively predicting global warming over the course of the twentieth century. This approximation is then used to calculate warming in response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases during the twenty-first century, projecting a temperature increase at the lower bound of results generated by an ensemble of ESMs (as presented in the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). This result can be interpreted as follows. The climate system is conceptually complex but has at its heart the physical laws of radiative transfer. This basic, or core physics is relatively straightforward to compute mathematically, as exemplified by Callendar's calculations, leading to quantitatively robust projections of baseline warming. The ESMs include not only the physical core but also climate feedbacks that introduce uncertainty into the projections in terms of magnitude, but not sign: positive (amplification of warming). As such, the projections of end-of century global warming by ESMs are fundamentally trustworthy: quantitatively robust baseline warming based on the well-understood physics of radiative transfer, with extra warming due to climate feedbacks. These projections thus provide a compelling case that global climate will continue to undergo significant warming in response to ongoing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.","[Anderson, Thomas R.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Hawkins, Ed] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Climate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Jones, Philip D.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Climat Res Unit, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Jones, Philip D.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Dept Meteorol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of East Anglia; King Abdulaziz University,"Anderson, TR (corresponding author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",tra@noc.ac.uk; e.hawkins@reading.ac.uk; p.jones@uea.ac.uk,"Jones, Philip Douglas/C-8718-2009; Hawkins, Ed/B-7921-2011","Jones, Philip Douglas/0000-0001-5032-5493; Hawkins, Ed/0000-0001-9477-3677","National Environment Research Council (NERC), UK; NERC Advanced Research Fellowship; National Centre for Atmospheric Science; NERC [noc010010, NE/I020792/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [noc010010, ncas10009, NE/I020792/1] Funding Source: researchfish","National Environment Research Council (NERC), UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC Advanced Research Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); National Centre for Atmospheric Science; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","TRA is funded by the National Environment Research Council (NERC), UK.

To identify the main contributors of increased N loading and evaluate the efficacy of water pollution control policies, it is essential to quantify and attribute the long-term changes in riverine N export. Here, we use a state-of-the-art terrestrial-aquatic interface model to examine how multiple environmental factors may have affected N export from the Chesapeake Bay watershed since 1900. These factors include changes in climate, carbon dioxide, land use, and N inputs (i.e., atmospheric N deposition, animal manure, synthetic N fertilizer use, and wastewater discharge). Our results estimated that ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) export increased substantially (66% for NH4+ and 123% for NO3-) from the 1900s to the 1990s and then declined (32% for NH4+ and 14% for NO3-) since 2000. The temporal trend of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) export paralleled that of dissolved inorganic N, while particulate organic nitrogen export was relatively constant during 1900-2015. Precipitation was the primary driver of interannual variability in N export to the Bay. Wastewater discharge explained most of the long-term change in riverine NH4+ and DON fluxes from 1900 to 2015. The changes in atmospheric deposition, wastewater, and synthetic fertilizer were responsible for the trend of riverine NO3-. In light of our model-based attribution analysis, terrestrial non-point source nutrient management will play an important role in achieving water quality goals. Plain Language Summary Excessive nitrogen can enter estuarine and coastal areas from land, disturbing coastal ecosystems and causing serious environmental problems. The Chesapeake Bay is one of the regions that have experienced hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in recent decades. This study estimated nitrogen export from the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) to the estuary from 1900 to 2015 by applying a state-of-the-art numerical model. Nitrogen loading from the CBW continually increased from the 1900s to the 1990s and has declined since then. The key contributors to nitrogen export have shifted from atmospheric nitrogen deposition (before the 1960s) to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer (after the 1980s). Antipollution policies and implementation measures have played critical roles in the decrease of nitrogen export since the 1980s, and further reduction in riverine nitrogen export will likely require regulation on the application of nitrogen fertilizer.","[Pan, Shufen; Bian, Zihao; Tian, Hanqin; Yao, Yuanzhi; Xu, Rongting] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Najjar, Raymond G.] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Friedrichs, Marjorie A.

Simulations from five state-of-the-art climate models performed at standard and high-resolution as part of the High-Resolution Model Inter-comparison Project (HighResMIP) were analysed. In some models, the resolution is enhanced in the atmospheric and oceanic components whereas, in some other models, the resolution is increased only in the atmosphere. Enhancing the horizontal resolution from non-eddy to eddy-permitting ocean produces stronger barotropic mass transports inside the subpolar and subtropical gyres. The first mode of inter-annual variability is associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in all the cases. The rapid ocean response to it consists of a shift in the position of the inter-gyre zone and it is better captured by the non-eddy models. The delayed ocean response consists of an intensification of the subpolar gyre (SPG) after around 3 years of a positive phase of NAO and it is better represented by the eddy-permitting oceans. A lagged relationship between the intensity of the SPG and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is stronger in the cases of the non-eddy ocean. Then, the SPG is more tightly coupled to the AMOC in low-resolution models.","[Meccia, Virna L.] Natl Res Council Italy ISAC CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Iovino, Doroteaciro; Bellucci, Alessio] Euro Mediterranean Ctr Climate Change, Bologna, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Meccia, VL (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ISAC CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy.",v.meccia@isac.cnr.it,"iovino, Doroteaciro/E-9759-2015","IOVINO, Doroteaciro/0000-0001-5132-7255; Meccia, Virna Loana/0000-0001-6905-2747; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921",European Commission under the PRIMAVERA project of the Horizon 2020 Research Programme [641727],European Commission under the PRIMAVERA project of the Horizon 2020 Research Programme,"This work was supported by the European Commission under the PRIMAVERA project, grant agreement no. 641727 of the Horizon 2020 Research Programme.",,61,0,0,3,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

This approach has been tested and performed at climate scale in several studies in recent decades for different areas. In this research, we investigate the added value of using an ensemble of three climate simulations at convection-permitting resolution (approx. 3 km) to replicate extreme precipitation events at both daily and shorter timescales over the south of France. These three convection-permitting simulations are performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. They are forced by three EURO-CORDEX simulations, which are also run with WRF at the resolution of 0.11 degrees (approx. 12 km). We found that a convection-permitting approach provides a more realistic representation of extreme daily and 3-hourly rainfall in comparison with EURO-CORDEX simulations. Their similarity to observations allows use for climate change studies and its impacts.","[Luu, Linh N.; Vautard, Robert; Yiou, Pascal] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR 8212, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Luu, Linh N.; Vautard, Robert; Yiou, Pascal] IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Soubeyroux, Jean-Michel] Meteo France, Direct Climatol & Serv Climat DCSC, Toulouse, France; [Luu, Linh N.] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Dept Res & Dev Weather & Climate Models RDWK, De Bilt, Netherlands",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Meteo France; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Luu, LN (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR 8212, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Luu, LN (corresponding author), IPSL, Gif Sur Yvette, France.;Luu, LN (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst KNMI, Dept Res & Dev Weather & Climate Models RDWK, De Bilt, Netherlands.",linh.luu@knmi.nl,,,ERC [338965-A2C2]; European Union [690462]; French Ministry for an Ecological and Solidary Transition; EUPHEME project,ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); European Union(European Commission); French Ministry for an Ecological and Solidary Transition; EUPHEME project,"This research has been supported by ERC (grant no. 338965-A2C2) and the EUPHEME project, which is part of ERA4CS, an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate and co-funded by the European Union (grant no. 690462).

While the risk of severe damages increases with the level of global warming (Dell et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014b, 2018; Lenton et al., 2008), mitigating costs increase steeply with more stringent warming limits (IPCC, 2014a; Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2015). Here, we show that the global warming limit that minimizes this century's total economic costs of climate change lies between 1.9 and 2 degrees C, if temperature changes continue to impact national economic growth rates as observed in the past and if instantaneous growth effects are neither compensated nor amplified by additional growth effects in the following years. The result is robust across a wide range of normative assumptions on the valuation of future welfare and inequality aversion. We combine estimates of climate-change impacts on economic growth for 186 countries (applying an empirical damage function from Burke et al., 2015) with mitigation costs derived from a state-of-the-art energy-economy-climate model with a wide range of highly resolved mitigation options (Kriegler et al., 2017; Luderer et al., 2013, 2015). Our purely economic assessment, even though it omits non-market damages, provides support for the international Paris Agreement on climate change. The political goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees is thus also an economically optimal goal given above assumptions on adaptation and damage persistence.","[Ueckerdt, Falko; Frieler, Katja; Lange, Stefan; Wenz, Leonie; Luderer, Gunnar; Levermann, Anders] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, Potsdam, Germany; [Ueckerdt, Falko; Frieler, Katja; Lange, Stefan; Wenz, Leonie; Luderer, Gunnar; Levermann, Anders] Leibniz Assoc, POB 60 12 03, Potsdam, Germany; [Wenz, Leonie] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Wenz, Leonie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Levermann, Anders] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA; [Levermann, Anders] Potsdam Univ, Inst Phys, Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Columbia University; University of Potsdam,"Frieler, K (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, Potsdam, Germany.;Frieler, K (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, POB 60 12 03, Potsdam, Germany.",katja.frieler@pik-potsdam.de,"Luderer, Gunnar/ABF-2346-2020; Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012; Levermann, Anders/G-4666-2011","Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Levermann, Anders/0000-0003-4432-4704; Wenz, Leonie/0000-0002-8500-1568",Hanley Sustainability Institute of the University of Dayton; Leibniz Competition [SAW-2013-PIK-5]; European Union [641811]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03EK3046A]; Volkswagen foundation; UC Berkeley,Hanley Sustainability Institute of the University of Dayton; Leibniz Competition; European Union(European Commission); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Volkswagen foundation(Volkswagen); UC Berkeley,"This research has been supported by the Hanley Sustainability Institute of the University of Dayton, the Leibniz Competition (no.

Here we show, by analysing observational and multi-model data and conducting SST-sensitivity experiments with two state-of-the-art atmospheric models, that the SST key area causing the recent Sahel rainfall recovery is the Mediterranean Sea. Anthropogenic warming of this region has driven the shift from the tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans, which historically were the main driver of Sahel drought.

This article analyzed the process of eco-environment monitoring, the uncertainty of geography information, and discussed the methods of data quality control. The Spot5 span data and multi-spectral data in 2003(2002) were used, combined with land use survey data at the scale of 1:10,000, topography data at the scale of 1:10,000, and the local Grain-for-Green project map. Also the social and economic data were collected. Eco-environmental monitoring is a process which consists of several steps, such as image geometric correction, image matching, information extraction, and so on. Based on visual and automated method, land information turned to grass and forest from cultivated land was obtained by comparing the information form remote sensing data with the land survey data, and local Grain-for-Green project data, combined with field survey. According to the process, the uncertainty in the process was analyzed. Positional uncertainty, attribute uncertainty, and thematic uncertainty was obvious. Positional uncertainty mainly derived from image geometric correction, such as data resource, the number and spatial distribution of the control points are important resource of uncertainty. Attribution uncertainty mainly derived from the process of information extraction. Land classification system, artificial error was the main factor induced uncertainty. Concept defined was not clear, and it reduced thematic uncertainty. According to the resource of uncertainty, data quality control methods were put forward to improve the data quality. At first, it is more important to choose appropriate remote sensing data and other basic data. Secondly, the accuracy of digital orthophoto map should be controlled. Thirdly, it is necessary to check the result data according to relative data quality criterion to guarantee GIS data quality.","[Lu Chunyan; Wang Jing] Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Land Use, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Lu, CY (corresponding author), Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Land Use, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6960-1,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,,3-Jan,,,X7957,X7957,,10.1117/12.780351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.780351,,,5,"Engineering, Aerospace; Remote Sensing; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Remote Sensing; Telecommunications,BHK09,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253704600284,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maximum anomalies are similar to4degreesC and similar to0.3 practical salinity units. Horizontal length scales are similar to1000 km. The anomalies travel at a speed consistent with advection by mean near-surface currents. Generation regions are located at western boundaries and possess an order of magnitude higher variability than all other regions. In some cases, surface heat fluxes are shown to cause anomaly generation; in other cases, surface current anomalies are likely to be responsible. Eastward anomaly propagation also occurs in the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean model. The coarser resolution Fast Ocean Rapid Troposphere Experiment ( FORTE) coupled model shows no propagating anomalies. Sea surface anomalies in the instrumental record are investigated, using ship-based sea surface temperature (SST) and heat fluxes, and satellite SST and altimetry. Unlike the models, Hovmoller plots and animations of the unfiltered observational data showed no evidence of eastward propagation. By applying a decadal-timescale band-pass filter to the SST time series, we identify underlying propagation of basin-scale anomalies in both HadCM3 and observations. Maximum anomalies are similar to1degreesC and length scales are similar to2500 km. These anomalies travel at speeds significantly slower than mean near-surface currents. Ten anomalies are identified during the period 1870-2002, mostly in the eastern Atlantic basin (east of 45degreesW). HadCM3 displayed only one propagating anomaly of this type in a typical 100 years of data. We discuss possible reasons for the range of results in models and observations.","Univ Southampton, Southampton Oceanog Ctr, James Rennell Div, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, Ocean Sci Div, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada",NERC National Oceanography Centre; University of Southampton; Bedford Institute of Oceanography; Fisheries & Oceans Canada,"Sinha, B (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Southampton Oceanog Ctr, James Rennell Div, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England.",bs@soc.soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,1,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-9275,2169-9291,,J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS,J.

An innovative and creative methodology was employed, cross-referencing and comparing data from 2011 and 2020. This methodology has led to the further strengthening of a new concept in sociology and the social sciences in general: profiguration (intergenerational and interdependent socialization). Based on the results of this study, some analytically robust descriptions were made of the socio-cultural and environmental situation in Rapa Nui, and of an increasingly sustainable social development model. It is a model of social development that is on the way to being sustainable, intercultural, intergenerational, and promoted by the community.","[Molina-Luque, Fidel] Univ Lleida, Dept Geog & Sociol, GESEC INDEST, Lleida 25003, Spain",Universitat de Lleida,"Molina-Luque, F (corresponding author), Univ Lleida, Dept Geog & Sociol, GESEC INDEST, Lleida 25003, Spain.",fidel.molinaluque@udl.cat,"Molina-Luque, Fidel/I-1185-2013","Molina-Luque, Fidel/0000-0001-5278-2794",INDEST [1619QT],INDEST,"This research was funded by INDEST, grant number 1619QTand The APC was funded by INDEST, grant number 1619QT.",,25,3,3,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,17,,,,,,6798,10.3390/su12176798,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12176798,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NO6SZ,,"Green Published, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000569620800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this paper is to fill this lacuna by analysing the market for circus, a worldwide popular performing art. To this aim, a demand-supply model is investigated using data on 107 Italian provinces over the period 2006-2007, by applying the SUR and the 3SLS methodologies. Findings confirm the economic theory, since price is negatively correlated with the quantity demanded and positively with the quantity supplied. According to our results circus is an inferior good. This result show that high and popular culture are far from competing each other. Cinema, theatre and concerts turn out to be feeble substitute goods for circus. Circuses in the South and Islands of Italy are characterised by longer stays in a single location probably due to higher appreciation for circus performances and favourable climate conditions. Since the determinants of popular culture demand are find to be different from those of high culture, our findings can be useful for policy makers to implement policies finalised to social inclusion and social cohesion.","[Castiglione, Concetta] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Cosenza, Italy; [Zanola, Roberto] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Inst Publ Policy & Publ Choice, Alessandria, Italy",University of Calabria; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Castiglione, C (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Cosenza, Italy.",concetta.castiglione@unical.it; roberto.zanola@uniupo.it,"Castiglione, Concetta/N-1037-2015","Castiglione, Concetta/0000-0002-9397-110X",,,,,48,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2199-322X,2199-3238,,ITAL ECON J,Ital.

When updated to include 2014 by Karl et al. using the new version of NOAA data, the observed warming trend is higher, but is still half or less, depending on dataset used, that of previous decades and the multi-model mean projections. This period is called a surface warming slowdown. Intense community efforts devoted to understanding this puzzling phenomenon-puzzling because atmospheric greenhouse gas accumulation has not abated while surface warming slowed-have yielded insights on our climate system, and this may be an opportune time to take stock of what we have learned. Proposed explanations differ on whether it is forced by counteracting agents (such as volcanic and pollution aerosols and stratospheric water vapor) or is an internal variability, and if the latter, on which ocean basin is responsible (Pacific, Indian, or Atlantic Ocean). Here we critically review the observational records, their analyses and interpretations, and offer interpretations of model simulations, with emphasis on sorting through the rather confusing signals at the ocean's surface, and reconciling them with the subsurface signals.","[Tung, Ka-Kit] Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chen, Xianyao] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xianyao] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Ocean University of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology,"Tung, KK (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Appl Math, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ktung@uw.edu; chenxy@ouc.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation [AGS-1262231]; National Key Basic Research Program of China [2015CB953900]; Natural Science Foundation of China [41776032]; Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers [U1606402]; Frederic and Julia Wan Endowed Professorship,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Key Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers; Frederic and Julia Wan Endowed Professorship,"The research of K.-K.T. was funded by National Science Foundation, under AGS-1262231 and Frederic and Julia Wan Endowed Professorship.

The GIFTS sensor is an imaging FTS with programmable spectral resolution and spatial scene selection, allowing radiometric accuracy and atmospheric sounding precision to be traded in near-real time for area coverage. System sensitivity is achieved through the use of a cryogenic Michelson interferometer and two large-area, IR focal plane detector arrays.

The End-to-end Demonstrator for improved decision-making in the water sector in Europe (EDgE) is a proof-of-concept project funded by the Copernicus Climate Change Service program that addresses these requirements by combining a multimodel ensemble of state-of-the-art climate model outputs and hydrological models to deliver sectoral climate impact indicators (SCIIs) codesigned with private and public water sector stakeholders from three contrasting European countries. The final product of EDgE is a water-oriented information system implemented through a web application. Here, we present the underlying structure of the EDgE modeling chain, which is composed of four phases: 1) climate data processing, 2) hydrological modeling, 3) stakeholder codesign and SCII estimation, and 4) uncertainty and skill assessments. Daily temperature and precipitation from observational datasets, four climate models for seasonal forecasts, and five climate models under two emission scenarios are consistently downscaled to 5-km spatial resolution to ensure locally relevant simulations based on four hydrological models. The consistency of the hydrological models is guaranteed by using identical input data for land surface parameterizations. The multimodel outputs are composed of 65 years of historical observations, a 19-yr ensemble of seasonal hindcasts, and a century-long ensemble of climate impact projections. These unique, high-resolution hydroclimatic simulations and SCIIs provide an unprecedented information system for decision-making over Europe and can serve as a template for water-related climate services in other regions.","[Samaniego, Luis; Thober, Stephan; Rakovec, Oldrich; Marx, Andreas; Kumar, Rohini] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Wanders, Niko] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pan, Ming; Wood, Eric F.] Princeton Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Sheffield, Justin] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Prudhomme, Christel; Buontempo, Carlo] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Prudhomme, Christel; Rees, Gwyn; Houghton-Carr, Helen; Fry, Matthew; Smith, Katie] NERC, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Watts, Glenn] Environm Agcy, Bristol, Avon, England; [Hisdal, Hege] Norwegian Ater Resources & Energy Directorate, Oslo, Norway; [Estrela, Teodoro] Confederac Hidrog Jucar, Valencia, Spain; [Rakovec, Oldrich] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Prudhomme, Christel] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Utrecht University; Princeton University; University of Southampton; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Loughborough University,"Samaniego, L (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany.",luis.samaniego@ufz.de,"Samaniego, Luis/G-8651-2011; Buontempo, Carlo/GLQ-7538-2022; Kumar, Rohini/B-2299-2013; Wanders, Niko/AAJ-2334-2021; Rakovec, Oldrich/N-5512-2015; Fry, Matt/G-6647-2019; Estrela, Teodoro/A-5800-2015","Samaniego, Luis/0000-0002-8449-4428; Buontempo, Carlo/0000-0002-1874-5380; Kumar, Rohini/0000-0002-4396-2037; Wanders, Niko/0000-0002-7102-5454; Rakovec, Oldrich/0000-0003-2451-3305; Fry, Matt/0000-0003-1142-4039; Estrela, Teodoro/0000-0003-3311-3303; Sheffield, Justin/0000-0003-2400-0630; Rees, Gwyn/0000-0003-3300-0472; Marx, Andreas/0000-0001-8173-2569; Facer-Childs, Katie/0000-0003-1060-9103", [C3S 441 Lot1 NERC],,"EDgE was performed under a contract (C3S 441 Lot1 NERC) for the Copernicus Climate Change Service (http://edge.climate.copernicus.eu).ECMWF implements this service and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service on behalf of the European Commission.

BAMis the new global atmospheric model of the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Research [Centro de Previsao de Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC)], which includes a new dynamical core and state-of-the-art parameterization schemes. BAM's dynamical core incorporates a monotonic two-time-level semi-Lagrangian scheme, which is carried out completely on the model grid for the tridimensional transport of moisture, microphysical prognostic variables, and tracers. The performance of the quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) from two convective schemes, the Grell-Devenyi (GD) scheme and its modified version (GDM), and two different horizontal resolutions are evaluated against the daily TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis over different tropical regions. Three main results are 1) the QPF skill was improved substantially with GDM in comparison to GD; 2) the increase in the horizontal resolution without any ad hoc tuning improves the variance of precipitation over continents with complex orography, such as Africa and South America, whereas over oceans there are no significant differences; and 3) the systematic errors (dry or wet biases) remain virtually unchanged for 5-day forecasts. Despite improvements in the tropical precipitation forecasts, especially over southeastern Brazil, dry biases over the Amazon and La Plata remain in BAM. Improving the precipitation forecasts over these regions remains a challenge for the future development of the model to be used not only for numerical weather prediction over South America but also for global climate simulations.","[Figueroa, Silvio N.; Bonatti, Jose P.; Kubota, Paulo Y.; Fernandez, Julio P.

The model was first presented in 2007 and has gained increasing attention. It is a core element of the Landcover 6k initiative within the PAGES project. The REVEALS model has two critical components: the pollen dispersal model and pollen productivity estimates (PPEs). To study the consequences of model settings, we implemented REVEALS in R. We use a state-of-the-art Lagrangian stochastic dispersal model (LSM) and compare model outcomes with calculations based on a conventional Gaussian plume dispersal model (GPM). In the LSM turbulence causes pollen fall speed to have little effect on the dispersal pattern whereas fall speed is a major factor in the GPM. Dispersal models are also used to derive PPEs. The unrealistic GPM produces PPEs that do not describe actual pollen productivity, but rather serve as a basin specific correction factor. A test with pollen and vegetation data from NE Germany shows that REVEALS performs best when applied with the LSM. REVEALS applications with the GPM can produce realistic results, but only if unrealistic PPEs are used. We discuss the derivation of PPEs and further REVEALS applications. Our REVEALS implementation is freely available as the 'REVEALSinR' function within the R package DISQOVER. REVEALSinR offers an environment for experimentation and analysing model sensitivities. We encourage further experiments and welcome comments on our tool.","[Theuerkauf, Martin] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Geog & Geol, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Str 16A, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Couwenberg, John] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Soldmannstr 15, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Theuerkauf, Martin; Couwenberg, John] Greifswald Mire Ctr, Soldmannstr 15, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Kuparinen, Anna] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Liebscher, Volkmar] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Math & Informat, Walther Rathenau Str 47, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany",Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; University of Helsinki; Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald,"Theuerkauf, M (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Geog & Geol, Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Str 16A, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.;Theuerkauf, M (corresponding author), Greifswald Mire Ctr, Soldmannstr 15, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.",martin.theuerkauf@uni-greifswald.de,"Liebscher, Volkmar/R-6865-2019; Liebscher, Volkmar/P-3543-2018","Liebscher, Volkmar/0000-0003-1446-4423; Liebscher, Volkmar/0000-0003-1446-4423; Couwenberg, John/0000-0002-3922-7099",Academy of Finland (AK),Academy of Finland (AK)(Academy of Finland),"We dedicate this paper to the memory of Roel Janssen and Herb Wright, whose knowledge and positive critical stance remain an inspiration.

In traditional artifacts, compatibility with the natural environment does exist and in many aspects has been suited with the climate and environmental features of every locality. The main purpose of the study is to identify and introduce the environmental features of pottery of Guilan, Iran. This is achieved by investigating the interaction between the local potters and their environment. The primary data are collected through library resources, field observation and visiting active potteries in Guilan. In this regard, the main research questions of the present study are as follows: What are the features of Guilan local pottery? What features are compatible with environmental standards? To conduct the study, a descriptive-analytical method is employed. The findings show that pottery in Guilan is not a threat to the environment in terms of local knowledge in using raw material, finding resources of renewable energy, community-based manpower, optimum exploitation of time and energy, potteryware designing with various functions, and re-using a product for further purposes. Nonetheless, there exist some issues which are not environmentally friendly like failure to modernize the potteryware to be of use for current needs, high rate of waste over the production process, and using toxic materials in glazing. Therefore, raising environmental awareness of locals, cultural diffusion, informing the users of the benefits of using pottery, and making improvements to the cycle of design, producing, and marketing all play substantial role in preserving local pottery.","[Ziaee, Majid] Shahed Univ, Art, Tehran, Iran; [Ziaee, Majid; Nadalian, Ahmad; Marasy, Mohsen] Shahed Univ, Fac Art, Tehran, Iran",Shahed University; Shahed University,"Nadalian, A (corresponding author), Shahed Univ, Fac Art, Tehran, Iran.",majidziaee@yahoo.com; nadalian@yahoo.com; marasy@shahed.ac.ir,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,KARABUK UNIV,KARABUK,"MAIN CAMPUS, BALIKLARKAYASI, KARABUK, 00000, TURKEY",2147-0626,,,TARIH KULT SANAT ARA,Tarih Kult.

Most of these structures were considered to be built in the 7th century as religious facilities of royal city Isanapura and abandoned in the 15th century. Since then, the brick structures in this site had been covered by dense forest and suffered severe damage due to the tropical climate. This archaeological site was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2017, and proper intervention is needed to preserve the remaining brick structures. The Sambor Prei Kuk Conservation Project carried out comprehensive research on the state of conservation for all 286 brick structures in this site. This project has developed a risk map, and carried out the survey of structural deformation and diagnosis of deterioration. Based on these surveys, the main causes of damage were identified: outward deformation of the base and foundation; thrust caused by the roof of the corbel arch; structural weakness at the door opening; fragmentation of brickwork by invasive vegetation; and impact of fallen tree. Finally, appropriate and acceptable restoration methods which can effectively stabilize and consolidate the brick structures to prevent further destruction while not negatively affecting the authenticity were discussed.","[Shimoda, Ichita] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Heritage Studies, Ibaraki, Japan; [So, Sokuntheary] Norton Univ, Dept Architecture & Urbanism, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Chan, Vitharong] Natl Author Sambor Prei Kuk, Dept Site Archaeol & Conservat, Kompong Thom, Cambodia",University of Tsukuba,"Shimoda, I (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Heritage Studies, Ibaraki, Japan.",shimoda@heritage.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [17H01628,24686068]; Foundation for Cultural Heritage and Art Research; Sumitomo Foundation","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Foundation for Cultural Heritage and Art Research; Sumitomo Foundation","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [17H01628,24686068]; Foundation for Cultural Heritage and Art Research; Sumitomo Foundation.",,25,0,0,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1558-3058,1558-3066,,INT J ARCHIT HERIT,Int.

The assessment of the vulnerability of the built environment to these hazards is a topic that is growing in importance due to climate change impacts. A proper understanding of vulnerability will lead to more effective risk assessment, emergency management and to the development of mitigation and preparedness activities all of which are designed to reduce the loss of life and economic costs. In this study, we are reviewing existing methods for vulnerability assessment related to mountain hazards. By analysing the existing approaches, we identify difficulties in their implementation (data availability, time consumption) and differences between them regarding their scale, the consideration of the hazardous phenomenon and its properties, the consideration of important vulnerability indicators and the use of technology such as GIS and remote sensing. Finally, based on these observations, we identify the future needs in the field of vulnerability assessment that include the user-friendliness of the method, the selection of all the relevant indicators, the transferability of the method, the inclusion of information concerning the hazard itself, the use of technology (GIS) and the provision of products such as vulnerability maps and the consideration of the temporal pattern of vulnerability.","[Papathoma-Koehle, M.; Kappes, M.; Keiler, M.; Glade, T.] Univ Vienna, Inst Geog & Reg Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Papathoma-Kohle, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Inst Geog & Reg Res, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",maria.papathoma@univie.ac.at,"Glade, Thomas/H-6325-2017; Papathoma-Köhle, Maria/B-7942-2016; Keiler, Margreth/F-4258-2012","Glade, Thomas/0000-0001-9676-4416; Papathoma-Köhle, Maria/0000-0002-7878-1340; Keiler, Margreth/0000-0001-9168-023X","EU [MRTN-CT-2006-035798, 211590]",EU(European Commission),"The authors would like to thank the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments in the earlier version of this paper.

Well-constrained sea level projections are needed to estimate future losses from SLR and benefits of climate protection and adaptation. Process-based models that are designed to resolve the underlying physics of individual sea level drivers form the basis for state-of-the-art sea level projections. However, associated computational costs allow for only a small number of simulations based on selected scenarios that often vary for different sea level components. This approach does not sufficiently support sea level impact science and climate policy analysis, which require a sea level projection methodology that is flexible with regard to the climate scenario yet comprehensive and bound by the physical constraints provided by process-based models. To fill this gap, we present a sea level model that emulates global-mean long-term process-based model projections for all major sea level components. Thermal expansion estimates are calculated with the hemispheric upwelling-diffusion ocean component of the simple carbon-cycle climate model MAGICC, which has been updated and calibrated against CMIP5 ocean temperature profiles and thermal expansion data. Global glacier contributions are estimated based on a parameterization constrained by transient and equilibrium process-based projections. Sea level contribution estimates for Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are derived from surface mass balance and solid ice discharge parameterizations reproducing current output from ice-sheet models. The land water storage component replicates recent hydrological modeling results. For 2100, we project 0.35 to 0.56m (66% range) total SLR based on the RCP2.6 scenario, 0.45 to 0.67m for RCP4.5, 0.46 to 0.71m for RCP6.0, and 0.65 to 0.97m for RCP8.5. These projections lie within the range of the latest IPCC SLR estimates. SLR projections for 2300 yield median responses of 1.02m for RCP2.6, 1.76m for RCP4.5, 2.38m for RCP6.0, and 4.73m for RCP8.5. The MAGICC sea level model provides a flexible and efficient platform for the analysis of major scenario, model, and climate uncertainties underlying long-term SLR projections. It can be used as a tool to directly investigate the SLR implications of different mitigation pathways and may also serve as input for regional SLR assessments via component-wise sea level pattern scaling.","[Nauels, Alexander; Meinshausen, Malte; Lorbacher, Katja] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Nauels, Alexander; Meinshausen, Malte] Univ Melbourne, Dept Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Meinshausen, Malte; Mengel, Matthias] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Wigley, Tom M.

The study explores the ways in which specific passive-cooling design strategies can be tailor-made to their locality, and residential buildings can be purpose-built and modified to optimise occupant thermal comfort and acclimatise indoor-air environments. A range of state-of-the-art vernacular passive-cooling designs that address the sustainability of a given proposal in relation to their respective locations and climate characteristics are presented; the extensive interpretations of these passive-cooling design strategies are in sharp contrast to the highly expensive, technical and exclusive environmental solutions that are so often universally applied in different locations, regardless of the physical, cultural and socio-economic contexts of each. The aim of this research is to investigate the efficiency of passive design systems in light of the thermal performance of prototype vernacular buildings to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of installing vernacular passive-cooling design strategies onto building envelopes. One of the prominent conceptual frameworks utilised in this paper is intended to address concerns related to the use of technologies that promote energy efficiency and ecological sustainability, most of which rely upon complex technological devices and a one-size-fits-all approach that only wealthy corporations and institutions are able to afford. Alternately, an increasing number of architects, theorists and politicians-albeit not yet enough-are investigating affordable technologies that are better able to be embedded in cultural practices. These manifestos are main determinant factors for a thorough review of the extant literature on passive-cooling design strategies and undertaking building energy simulations on base-case prototype vernacular buildings to demonstrate the energy effectiveness of implementing existing construction strategies onto current building envelopes. The study findings suggest that contemporary design methods lack sustainable designs on a purely technical basis on which it is typically discussed and demonstrates that significantly more needs to be done to conform to locally identifiable requirements and practices. It was determined that while many of vernacular passive-cooling design strategies are still effective, others are disappearing due to changes in construction technology. This systematic review outlines an alternative, hybrid approach to sustain ability that is proudly inherent in vernacular environmental design principles. The study conclusions offer an alternative perspective on sustainable design and brings to the forefront a broader systematic analysis of current literature that focusses on environmental technologies in the south-eastern Mediterranean area and the Middle East, where the weather is subtropical (Csa) and partly semi-arid (Bsh). The study further demonstrates that for environmental design to be sustainable, a fundamental reorientation needs to emerge and move away from current construction practices with purely understanding of the domestic built environment, which fails to address the societal values of a particular place and people; and the findings underscore the necessity of recalling invisible technologies that are embedded in socio-cultural practices to effectively ventilate our dwellings and optimise occupant levels of thermal comfort throughout the year.

In particular, it is held that Be-10 production rates in the atmosphere depend on the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, and the fallout and deposition of cosmogenic beryllium at the surface happen on a very short time scale. However, investigations performed on terrestrial and marine successions demonstrate that the Be-10 record and the paleomagnetic signal are often asynchronous. Mechanisms that control the conveyance and deposition of cosmogenic Be-10 to the seafloor are still ambiguous and poorly documented. Here, we discuss the dynamics of Be-10 in a central Mediterranean marginal marine depositional scenario characterized by a pervasive terrigenous influx. Our data show that a very close correlation exists between Be-10 concentrations and the local proxy of rainfall rates and regimes (pollen), indicating that a considerable Be-10 transport from the mainland may occur in response to the remobilization of terrestrial reservoirs during periods of increased runoff. Superimposed is a dynamic oceanographic setting that further controls the preservation potential of Be-10 at the bottom, in terms of changing water chemistry and/or composition of the sedimentary flux to the seafloor. Results of our investigation suggest that, in particular environmental and depositional settings, the interplay between climate, terrigenous yield and oceanography may jeopardize the sedimentary depiction of the meteoric Be-10 contribution, thus challenging the use of Be-10 for tracking the stratigraphic position of geomagnetic reversals.

Excavations of two multi-period hearth sites in the Jebel Oraf palaeolake basin, in the oasis of Jubbah, now substantially increase our knowledge of these sites. In total, 17 of 170 identified hearths were excavated at Jebel Oraf 2 (ORF2), an open-air site on the edge of a palaeolake. In addition, 11 hearths were excavated at the stratified site of Jebel Oraf 115 (ORF115), a rockshelter formed by two boulders. Radiocarbon dating and lithic assemblages indicate that the majority of these hearths were in use in the second half of the 6th millennium BCE, and that both sites were used sporadically until the recent past. All hearths appear to have been extremely shortlived, and faunal remains suggest they may have been used to cook meat from hunted or trapped wildlife, and occasionally from livestock. The frequent use of grinding stones, often broken into fragments and used to cover hearths is also attested. Evidence for the exceptionally early use of metal from dated occupation deposits as well as from rock art, shows that these short-lived sites were well connected to technological innovations in the wider region.","[Guagnin, Maria; Petraglia, Michael] Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany; [Shipton, Ceri; Martin, Louise; Kingwell-Banham, Eleanor] UCL, Inst Archaeol, London, England; [Breeze, Paul] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Graham, Lisa] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Open Learning, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ott, Florian] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Potsdam, Germany; [Stewart, Mathew] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol Sci Human Hist & Biogeo, Extreme Events Res Grp, Jena, Germany; [El-Dossary, Sarah] Minist Educ, Riyadh Educ Author, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Zahrani, Badr; Al-Omari, Abdulaziz] Minist Tourism, Heritage Commiss, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Alsharekh, Abdullah M.] King Saud Univ, Coll Tourism & Archaeol, Dept Archaeol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Petraglia, Michael] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Anthropol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Petraglia, Michael] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Petraglia, Michael] Griffith Univ, Australian Res Ctr Human Evolut ARCHE, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of London; University College London; University of London; King's College London; University of Edinburgh; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; King Saud University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; University of Queensland; Griffith University,"Guagnin, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Sci Human Hist, Dept Archaeol, Jena, Germany.",guagnin@shh.mpg.de,"Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021","Guagnin, Maria/0000-0002-7995-8611; Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727","SCTH; European Research Council [295719]; Max Planck Society; Dahlem Research School; Leverhulme Trust [ECF-2019-538]; Research Center at the College of Tourism & Archaeology, King Saud University","SCTH; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); Dahlem Research School; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Research Center at the College of Tourism & Archaeology, King Saud University","We thank His Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin Salman, former President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH), and Prof. Ali Ghabban, former Vice President, for permission to carry out this research.

The altitude of comparable vegetation zones showed a sharp increase of 1400-1900 m from east to west. Forest limit reached an altitude of 4400-4600 m in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, being the highest forest limit in the world. The limidng factor for the upper limit of a vegetation zone was different in the east and west. Low temperature in winter controlled the upward distribution of the evergreen broadleaf forest in the east, whereas the limiting factor was growing season warmth in the west. A close correlation was found between the climatic indices and annual range of monthly mean temperature (ART) at the upper limit of a vegetation zone. Component genera of each vegetation zone along the 30 degrees N parallel were analyzed, and it was found that the alternation of component genera from east to west was much more apparent in cool-temperate forests, reflecting their response to macrotopography and air masses. The distribution of Fagus extended into winter-cold regions, whilst Tsuga occurred principally in oceanic and warm climates. The northern limit of Tsuga corresponded well to an ART isotherm of 23 degrees C and its southern limit coincided with that of Fagus. According to the distribution of Fagus and Tsuga, the cool-temperate forests in East Asia along the 30 degrees N belt were divided into three types: deciduous broadleaf forest (represented by Fagus), mixed forest (dominated by Fagus, Tsuga and others), and mixed evergreen forest (consisting mainly of Tsuga and sclerophyll oaks).","CHIBA UNIV,FAC SCI,ECOL LAB,INAGE KU,CHIBA 263,JAPAN; LAKE BIWA RES INST,OTSU,SHIGA 520,JAPAN",Chiba University,"Fang, JY (corresponding author), CHINESE ACAD SCI,ECOENVIRONM SCI RES CTR,POB 2871,BEIJING 100085,PEOPLES R CHINA.",,"Fang, Jingyun/A-4282-2009",,,,,,78,49,62,1,28,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0042-3106,,,VEGETATIO,Vegetatio,OCT,1996,2,,,,135,149,,10.1007/BF00045600,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00045600,,,15,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,VU194,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:A1996VU19400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a life cycle approach, the study compared the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of direct electric heating, a conventional air-source heat pump, and a novel ground-source air heat pump innovated by a citizen user, to assess whether such user innovation holds benefit. The energy use of the heat pumps was modeled at six temperature intervals based on duration curves of outdoor temperature. Additionally, two heat pump end-of-life scenarios were analyzed. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis was applied using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicated that, in ideal conditions, that is, assuming perfect air mixing, the conventional air-source heat pump's emissions were over 40% lower and the ground-air heat pump's emissions over 70% lower than in the case of direct electric heating. Although proper handling of the refrigerant is important, total leakage from the retirement of the heat-pump appliance would increase GHG emissions by just 10%. According to the sensitivity analysis, the most influential input parameters are the emission factor related to electricity and the amount of electricity used for heating.","[Mattinen, Maija K.; Nissinen, Ari] Finnish Environm Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Hyysalo, Sampsa] Aalto Univ, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Codesign, Helsinki, Finland; [Hyysalo, Sampsa; Juntunen, Jouni K.] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; Aalto University; Aalto University,"Mattinen, MK (corresponding author), SYKE, Finnish Environm Inst, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",maija.mattinen@ymparisto.fi,"Hyysalo, Sampsa/AAB-9280-2019; Juntunen, Jouni K/I-8315-2015","Juntunen, Jouni K/0000-0001-8137-8985; Nissinen, Ari/0000-0003-3413-2581; Hyysalo, Sampsa/0000-0003-0545-0011",Academy of Finland [AKA 140933],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),The funding from Academy of Finland grant for Local Adaptation and Innovation in Practice in Achieving Carbon Neutrality (AKA 140933) is gratefully acknowledged.,,42,25,25,1,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

In present study, the role of aerosols in the precipitation changes over IGP region is investigated using Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-5 (CMIP5) experiments with adequate representation of aerosols in state-of-the art climate models. The climatological sea surface temperature experiments are used to explore the relative impact of the aerosols. The diagnostic analysis on representation of aerosols and precipitation over Indian region was investigated in CMIP5 models. After the evaluation, multi-model ensemble was used for further analysis. It is revealed from the analysis that aerosol-forcing plays an important role in observed weakening of the monsoon circulation and decreased precipitation over the IGP region. The significant cooling of the continental Indian region (mainly IGP) caused by the aerosols leads to reduction in land sea temperature contrast, which further leads to weakening of monsoon overturning circulation and reduction in precipitation.","[Sanap, S.

Climate model simulations have shown severe resulting climate perturbations with declines in global mean temperature by 1.8 degrees C and precipitation by 8%, for at least 5 y. Here we evaluate impacts for the global food system. Six harmonized state-of-the-art crop models show that global caloric production from maize, wheat, rice, and soybean falls by 13 (+/- 1)%, 11 (+/- 8)%, 3 (+/- 5)%, and 17 (+/- 2)% over 5 y. Total single-year losses of 12 (+/- 4)% quadruple the largest observed historical anomaly and exceed impacts caused by historic droughts and volcanic eruptions. Colder temperatures drive losses more than changes in precipitation and solar radiation, leading to strongest impacts in temperate regions poleward of 30 degrees N, including the United States, Europe, and China for 10 to 15 y. Integrated food trade network analyses show that domestic reserves and global trade can largely buffer the production anomaly in the first year. Persistent multiyear losses, however, would constrain domestic food availability and propagate to the Global South, especially to food-insecure countries. By year 5, maize and wheat availability would decrease by 13% globally and by more than 20% in 71 countries with a cumulative population of 1.3 billion people. In view of increasing instability in South Asia, this study shows that a regional conflict using <1% of the worldwide nuclear arsenal could have adverse consequences for global food security unmatched in modern history.","[Jaegermeyr, Jonas; Elliott, Joshua; Foster, Ian] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jaegermeyr, Jonas; Puma, Michael J.; Heslin, Alison; Rosenzweig, Cynthia] NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Jaegermeyr, Jonas; Mueller, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Leibniz Assoc, Climate Resilience, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Robock, Alan; Xia, Lili] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Khabarov, Nikolay; Folberth, Christian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Schmid, Erwin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Econ Dev, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Liu, Wenfeng] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Liu, Wenfeng] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal Integrated Assessment & Modeling, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Zabel, Florian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Geog, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Rabin, Sam S.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Puma, Michael J.; Heslin, Alison; Rosenzweig, Cynthia] Columbia Univ, Ctr Climate Syst Res, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Franke, James] Univ Chicago, Dept Geophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Foster, Ian] Argonne Natl Lab, Data Sci & Learning Div, Lemont, IL 60439 USA; [Asseng, Senthold] Univ Florida, Agr Biol Engn Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bardeen, Charles G.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Bardeen, Charles G.; Toon, Owen B.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Atmospher & Space Phys, Boulder, CO 80303 USA","University of Chicago; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Columbia University; University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","Jagermeyr, J (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Jagermeyr, J (corresponding author), NASA, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA.;Jagermeyr, J (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Leibniz Assoc, Climate Resilience, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",jaegermeyr@uchicago.edu,"Foster, Ian/GNH-1877-2022; Schmid, Erwin/Z-1946-2019; Robock, Alan/B-6385-2016; Müller, Christoph/E-4812-2016; Liu, Wenfeng/D-3715-2017","Foster, Ian/0000-0003-2129-5269; Schmid, Erwin/0000-0003-4783-9666; Müller, Christoph/0000-0002-9491-3550; Liu, Wenfeng/0000-0002-8699-3677; Heslin, Alison/0000-0001-9868-5586; Jagermeyr, Jonas/0000-0002-8368-0018; Zabel, Florian/0000-0002-2923-4412","Open Philanthropy Project; University of Chicago Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy (RDCEP) (NSF) [SES-146364]; NSF [ACI-1532235, ACI-1532236]; Army Research Office/Army Research Laboratory [W911NF1810267]",Open Philanthropy Project; University of Chicago Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy (RDCEP) (NSF); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Office/Army Research Laboratory,"We thank AgMIP for coordination support for the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison and Deepak Ray for providing yield reference data.

However, there remain gaps in our understanding of the fate of infectious faecal pathogens during composting, particularly in tropical climates. This study investigated the influence of different locally available bulking agents on the inactivation efficiency of composting by tracking the fate of four key indicator organisms (E. roll, Salmonella spp., Enterococci spp., and viable helminth eggs). Dewatered FS was mixed with different bulking agents - i.e. Sawdust (SD), Coffee husks (CH) and Brewery waste (BW). Compost piles of FS:SD, FS:CH, and FS:BW in a volumetric ratio of 1:2 were set-up in duplicate (3 m(3) each), composted on a pilot scale and monitored weekly for the survival of pathogen indicators for a period of 15 weeks. The study findings suggest that the different bulking agents have a statistically significant (p < 0.05) effect on the temperature evolution and survival of pathogen indicators in compost. CH was the most suitable bulking agent for composting with FS as piles containing CH exhibited higher pathogen inactivation efficiency and shorter inactivation periods of 6 weeks compared to 8 weeks for SD and BW piles. Time-temperature was the most important factor responsible for pathogen inactivation. However, other mechanisms such as indigenous microbial and toxic by-products such as NH4+-N also played an important role in the inactivation of pathogens. The results suggest that co-composting of FS with a sawdust, coffee husk or brewery waste for 8 weeks with thermophilic temperatures of about 48-60 degrees C sustained in the composting piles for more than 38 days, using 7 days turning frequency, is sufficient to ensure complete sanitization of FS before reuse in agriculture.","[Manga, M.; Anthonj, C.] Univ N Carolina, Water Inst UNC, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, 4114 McGavran Hall,Campus Box 7431, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Manga, M.; Camargo-Valero, M.

Adapting to climate change impacts is not only an issue of the future cities but a worrying situation of the present. For most local governments of water sensitive cities in the Middle East, adapting to extreme weather events and mitigating climate change are important issues. Moreover, ancient cities in the Middle East, like Qazvin, are outstanding samples of flood adaptation and mitigation that are still in use. This paper demonstrates how well the ancient blue-green infrastructure in Qazvin provides a base for taking advantage of floods and how the system can adapt to future climate change. Therefore, the results present how ancient blue-green infrastructure can manage flash floods and how they can be seen as a context for smart flood management. During flash floods, the blue-green infrastructure collects floodwater as well as distribute it at the same time. Thus, the system not only can mitigate the adverse effects of seasonal floods but also adapt to climate change through drought conditions. The blue-green infrastructure in Qazvin is an excellent example of ancient science implemented to mitigate climate change. The research method is evidence-based and case-specific. This paper presents a practical integrated solution as a base for smart water management. Exploring ancient science and implementing our ancestors' ideas and techniques can pave our way toward future smart and sustainable cities and give us more effective solutions to smart flood management.","[Ghaleh, Marzieh Rezaei] Arizona State Univ, Design Sch, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Ghaleh, Maryam Rezaei] Tabriz Art Univ, Architecture & Urban Planning, Tabriz, Iran",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Ghaleh, MR (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Design Sch, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",mrezaeig@asu.edu; m.rezaeighaleh@tabriziau.ac.ir,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2158-3404,,978-1-6654-1507-1,INT SYMP TECHNOL SOC,,,2021,,,,,417,421,,10.1109/ISTAS50296.2020.9462209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISTAS50296.2020.9462209,,,5,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BS9OI,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000783309400062,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we compare the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), northward ocean heat transport and ocean stratification simulated with these models. None of the models participating in PlioMIP simulates a strong mid-Pliocene AMOC as suggested by earlier proxy studies. Rather, there is no consistent increase in AMOC maximum among the PlioMIP models. The only consistent change in AMOC is a shoaling of the overturning cell in the Atlantic, and a reduced influence of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at depth in the basin. Furthermore, the simulated mid-Pliocene Atlantic northward heat transport is similar to the pre-industrial. These simulations demonstrate that the reconstructed high-latitude mid-Pliocene warming can not be explained as a direct response to an intensification of AMOC and concomitant increase in northward ocean heat transport by the Atlantic.","[Zhang, Z. -S.; Nisancioglu, K.

A pilot preoperational forecasting system is introduced in which the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction system and seasonal climate forecasts of temperature and rainfall are used to drive the uncalibrated dynamical malaria model VECTRI to predict anomalies in transmission intensity 4months ahead. It is demonstrated that the system has statistically significant skill at a number of sentinel sites in Uganda with high-quality data. Skill is also found at approximately 50% of the Ugandan health districts despite inherent uncertainties of unconfirmed health reports. A cost-loss economic analysis at three example sentinel sites indicates that the forecast system can have a positive economic benefit across a broad range of intermediate cost-loss ratios and frequency of transmission anomalies. We argue that such an analysis is a necessary first step in the attempt to translate climate-driven malaria information to policy-relevant decisions. Plain Language Summary The malaria parasite and its mosquito vector are both weather sensitive, with temperature impacting development rates and mortality, and rainfall providing mosquito breeding sites. We take advantage of these effects to provide forecasts of malaria transmission intensity up to 4months ahead, using a state-of-the-art climate prediction system to drive a mathematical model of the parasite/vector cycle. The system is evaluated to have skill in Uganda at the district and local clinic scale, a first for subnational forecasts. We then perform an economic analysis to show at which range of decision entry points and anomalous transmission events the system has positive benefit, necessary for integration into decision-making processes.","[Tompkins, Adrian M.] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe J.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Di Giuseppe, Francesca] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Namanya, Didacus B.] Minist Hlth, Kampala, Uganda",Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); University of East Anglia; University of East Anglia; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF),"Tompkins, AM (corresponding author), Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Earth Syst Phys, Trieste, Italy.",tompkins@ictp.it,"Tompkins, Adrian/N-6472-2013","Tompkins, Adrian/0000-0003-0975-6691; Colon-Gonzalez, Felipe de Jesus/0000-0002-9671-3405","EUFP7 project of Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI) [243964]; EUFP7 project of HEALTHY FUTURES [266327]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response at King's College London","EUFP7 project of Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI); EUFP7 project of HEALTHY FUTURES; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response at King's College London","This research was partly funded through the EUFP7 projects of Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries (QWeCI, grant agreement 243964) and HEALTHY FUTURES (grant agreement 266327).

CO2 and CH4 have been widely considered as the main greenhouse gases causing global warming and climate change. The CO2 reforming of CH4 (CRM) reaction can simultaneously convert both CO2 and CH4 into value-added synthesis gas (H-2 + CO) and also alleviate the emission of these two greenhouse gases. Ni-Based catalysts have been widely investigated as the most promising candidates for CRM owing to their advanced activities and low price. However, the Ni-based catalysts usually suffer rapid deactivation due to the thermal sintering of metallic Ni active sites and surface carbon deposition during the CRM reaction at high temperatures (>640 degrees C). To address this challenge, researchers worldwide have devoted great efforts to developing highly efficient and stable Ni-based catalysts. However, it is extremely difficult to achieve this aim by using the traditional supported catalysts because of the weak metal-support interaction. Therefore, the concept of Ni-based confinement catalysts, such as core-shell catalysts, mesoporous catalysts, layered catalysts, and Ni-containing crystalline compound catalysts, have been proposed and developed to address the challenge of the thermal sintering of the metallic Ni active sites by the space and/or lattice confinement effects of these structures. As a result, the metallic Ni active site can be firmly stabilized and the surface carbon deposition can be effectively inhibited owing to the size effect of the metallic Ni active sites. This review mainly summarizes the state-of-the-art progress of the Ni-based confinement catalysts with advanced performances for CRM. Specifically, the Ni-based catalysts with different confinement types, including pore channel confinement, core-shell structure confinement, interlayer structure confinement, and crystalline lattice confinement, have been summarized. The significant impacts of the confinement effect on the stabilization of the Ni-based CRM catalysts are discussed in detail. The influences of the preparation methods on the catalytic performance of the Ni-based catalysts are also discussed and their development trends have been determined.","[Xue, Yingying; Xu, Leilei; Chen, Mindong; Cheng, Ge] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wu, Cai-e] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Light Ind & Food Engn, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ning] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Environm & Life, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xun] Jinan Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing Forestry University; Beijing University of Technology; University of Jinan,"Xu, LL; Chen, MD (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Atmospher Environm & Equip, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Atmospher Environm Monitoring & P, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Hu, X (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China.",leileixu88@gmail.com; chenmdnuist@163.com; Xun.Hu@outlook.com,,"Hu, Xun/0000-0003-4329-2050","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21503113, 21871144, 21577065, 21976094]; National Key Research and Development Project [2018YFC0213802]; Environmental Protection Projects of Jiangsu Province [2017022]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [SJCX20_0309]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20190786]; Startup Foundation of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Project; Environmental Protection Projects of Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Startup Foundation of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology","The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21503113, 21871144, 21577065, 21976094), the National Key Research and Development Project (Grant No. 2018YFC0213802), Environmental Protection Projects of Jiangsu Province (2017022), a Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (SJCX20_0309), and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20190786).

Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict untrained physical variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here, we show that differentiable, learnable, process-based models (called delta models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM for the intensively observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, enhance, or replace the process-based model's modules. Without using an ensemble or post-processor, delta models can obtain a median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.732 for 671 basins across the USA for the Daymet forcing data set, compared to 0.748 from a state-of-the-art LSTM model with the same setup. For another forcing data set, the difference is even smaller: 0.715 versus 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables, for example, soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow, and can later be constrained by their observations. Both simulated evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various process complexity and opens up the path for learning physics from big data.","[Feng, Dapeng; Liu, Jiangtao; Lawson, Kathryn; Shen, Chaopeng] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Shen, CP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",cshen@engr.psu.edu,,"Lawson, Kathryn/0000-0003-0075-7911; Shen, Chaopeng/0000-0002-0685-1901; Feng, Dapeng/0000-0002-5653-6504; Liu, Jiangtao/0000-0002-9219-8354","US National Science Foundation [1832294, 2221880, 1940190, 2018280]; Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0016605]",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),DF was supported by US National Science Foundation Awards EAR #1832294 and EAR #2221880.

Lithofacies in such low-energy deposits are typically fine-grained, developed uniformly in a generally concentric distribution (bulls-eye' pattern) and are predictable even when preserved imperfectly. In contrast, because of their local lithofacies and palaeontological complexities, fluvial carbonates were either delegated to a status of minor geomorphological features' or barely considered prior to the 1970s. This viewpoint was based on the depositional record of fluvial and spring-fed fresh water carbonates, which were considered to be restricted generally to localized karstic areas. Such deposits are often preserved as scattered patches of ambient temperature tufa. Occasionally, however, in active tectonic areas, localized travertine deposits are also developed from deeply circulating hydrothermal waters. With a few exceptions (for example, basins with high subsidence rates or in arid climate zones), these fresh water carbonates are prone to erosion from continuing river incision and thus may not be preserved in the geological record. A partial record of fluvial and spring-deposited carbonates is often preserved in Quaternary deposits, but the record in older deposits is typically fragmentary and often diagenetically modified. Yet once their unique facies architecture (and specialized nomenclature) is understood, these carbonates provide an important record of past sedimentological cycles of great value in palaeoenvironmental landscape modelling. The emphasis of modern research is to acquire information that explains how active systems function. In this respect, tufas reveal much of how carbonate precipitation is a shared product of physico-chemical and microbiological biomediation processes. Likewise, travertines not only show an intimate interrelation with active tectonism but also hold great potential as monitors of past volcanic carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, both tufas and travertines contain palynological records that can be used as proxy indicators of climate change. Perhaps no other field of sedimentology has witnessed more developments and applications over such a brief period of study.","[Capezzuoli, Enrico; Gandin, Anna] Univ Siena, Dept Phys Earth & Environm Sci, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Pedley, Martyn] Univ Hull, Dept Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Siena; University of Hull,"Capezzuoli, E (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Phys Earth & Environm Sci, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",capezzuoli@unisi.it,"Capezzuoli, Enrico/A-8915-2015","Capezzuoli, Enrico/0000-0002-4199-1870",Tuscan Regional Administration,Tuscan Regional Administration,"We warmly thank R.

This study analyzes outputs from multiple climate models participating in the Fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) using the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observations Simulator Package (COSP), and compares them with different satellite data sets. Those include CALIPSO lidar observations, PARASOL mono-directional reflectances and CERES radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere. We show that current state-of-the-art climate models predict overly bright low-clouds, even for a correct low-cloud cover. The impact of these biases on the Earth' radiation budget, however, is reduced by compensating errors. Those include the tendency of models to under-estimate the low-cloud cover and to overestimate the occurrence of mid-and high-clouds above low-clouds. Finally, we show that models poorly represent the dependence of the vertical structure of low-clouds on large-scale environmental conditions. The implications of this 'too few, too bright low-cloud problem' for climate sensitivity and model development are discussed. Citation: Nam, C., S. Bony, J.-L. Dufresne, and H.

The ability to forecast ENSO accurately is crucially important to human livelihoods worldwide. ENSO is characterized by strong winter-peaking sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the central-eastern tropical Pacific during the mature phase. However, the bias in simulating ENSO phase-locking behavior persists in climate models. In this study, the ENSO seasonal phase-locking behaviors simulated in 42 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are evaluated by comparing 43 CMIP5 models and observations. Only a few models (12 CMIP5 and 15 CMIP6) simulated ENSO with a majority proportion of winter-peaking events, which indicates that reasonable ENSO seasonal phase-locking is still a challenge for state-of-the-art climate models. Furthermore, the seasonal cycle of the zonal SST gradient along the equator can explain approximately 24% and 27% of the variance in the ENSO phase-locking for CMIP5 and CMIP6, respectively. In particular, the strengths of the zonal SST gradient in the central-eastern Pacific during boreal spring and autumn are crucial. The biases in simulating the seasonal changes in the zonal SST gradient influence the zonal advective feedback's strengths that respond to the anomalous SST of ENSO, therefore disturbing the simulation of ENSO phase-locking. Improvement of the simulated ENSO phase-locking should be realized by focusing on the zonal SST gradient's seasonal cycle.","[Liao, Huaxia; Wang, Chunzai] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou 510301, Peoples R China; [Liao, Huaxia; Wang, Chunzai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Song, Zhenya] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Song, Zhenya] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Marine Sci & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Song, Zhenya] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology","Song, ZY (corresponding author), 6 Xian Xia Ling Rd, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.",songroy@fio.org.cn,"Wang, Chunzai/C-9712-2009; Song, Zhenya/F-9819-2013","Wang, Chunzai/0000-0002-7611-0308; Liao, Huaxia/0000-0003-4331-3421; Song, Zhenya/0000-0002-8098-5529","CMIP; ESGF; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42022042, 41821004]; China Korea Cooperation Project on Northwestern Pacific Climate Change and its Prediction",CMIP; ESGF; National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Korea Cooperation Project on Northwestern Pacific Climate Change and its Prediction,"We thank Prof. Yongqiang Yu for the valuable suggestion, and Xiang Han for the help in the data collection.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature and WA on the photosynthetic performance and photosynthetic limitations of the only two Antarctic vascular species: Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. We hypothesize that: the ability of Antarctic plants to increase their net CO2 assimilation (A(N)) in response to raising growth temperature would be constrained by mesophyll conductance (g(m)); and decreases in water availability may counteract any benefit in carbon gain obtained upon increasing temperature. To address this issue, both species were grown (T-g) and measured (T-m) at three different temperatures (5, 10 and 16 degrees C). Furthermore, two different irrigation conditions (well-watered, WW, and water-deficit, WD) were applied at 16 degrees C. Gas-exchange measurements showed that A(N) and their underlying diffusive (g(s) and g(m)) and biochemical components (V-cmax) were mainly determined by T-g and, to a lesser extent by T-m. Warmer conditions favor A(N) of both species, although D. antarctica requires higher increases of temperature to show the same response. Changes in A(N) in response to either temperature or WA are due to proportional concomitant changes of stomatal and mesophyll conductances, and carboxylation capacity. However, g(m) remains the most important limitation at any environmental condition. Reduced WA can completely counteract any benefit to photosynthesis induced by raising temperature, suggesting that these species may present a quite homeostatic photosynthetic response to the climate changes predicted for the Antarctic region.","[Saez, Patricia L.; Ramirez, Constanza F.; Poblete, Leticia; Rivera, Betsy K.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Dept Silviculture, Lab Cult Tejidos Vegetales,Ctr Biotecnol, Concepcion, Chile; [Galmes, Jeroni; Jose Clemente-Moreno, Maria; Flexas, Jaume] UIB, Inst Agroecol & Econ Agua INAGEA, Res Grp Plant Biol Mediterranean Condit, Balearic Isl, Spain; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion, Chile; [Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Lab Fisiol & Biol Mol Vegetal,Sci & Technol Biore, Dept Ciencias Agron & Recursos Nat,Ctr Plant Soil, Inst Agroind,Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, Temuco, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de La Frontera,"Saez, PL (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Dept Silviculture, Lab Cult Tejidos Vegetales,Ctr Biotecnol, Concepcion, Chile.",patrisaez@udec.cl,"Bravo, León/AAO-8437-2020; Clemente-Moreno, Maria Jose/G-5339-2011","Bravo, León/0000-0003-4705-4842; Saez, Patricia L./0000-0002-8594-7329; Clemente-Moreno, Maria Jose/0000-0003-3288-6312",National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development [11130332]; Associative Research Program of CONICYT [PIA ART-1102]; Support Program for the Formation of International Networks between Research Centers [REDES-170102]; Chilean Antarctic Institute [FI-02-13]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CTM2014-53902-C2-1-P]; ERDF (FEDER),National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Associative Research Program of CONICYT; Support Program for the Formation of International Networks between Research Centers; Chilean Antarctic Institute; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); ERDF (FEDER)(European Commission),"This research was funded by The National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (Grant no.11130332), The Associative Research Program of CONICYT (Grant no.

Here, the number of premature deaths in Europe from different diseases associated to the ambient exposure to PM2.5 have here been studied both for present (1991-2010) and future periods (2031-2050, RCP8.5 scenario). This contribution combines different state-of-the-art approaches (use of highresolution climate/chemistry simulations over Europe for providing air quality data; use of different baseline mortality data for specific European regions; inclusion of future population projections and dynamical changes for 2050 obtained from the United Nations (UN) Population Projections or use of non-linear exposure-response functions) to estimate the premature mortality due to PM2.5. The mortality endpoints included in this study are Lung Cancer (LC), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cerebrovascular Disease (CEV), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Lower Respiratory Infection (LRI) and other Non-Communicable Diseases (other NCDs). Different risk ratio and baseline mortalities for each disease end each age range have been estimated individually. The results indicate that the annual excess mortality rate from fine particulate matter in Europe is 904,000 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 733,100-1,067,800], increasing by 73% in 2050s (1,560,000; 95% CI 1,260,000-1,840,000); meanwhile population decreases from 808 to 806 million according to the UN estimations. The results show that IHD is the main cause of premature mortality in Europe associated to PM2.5 (around 48%) both for the present and future periods. Despite several marked regional differences, premature deaths associated to all the endpoints included in this study will increase in the future period due to the climate penalty but especially because of changes in the population projected and its aging.","[Tarin-Carrasco, Patricia; Palacios-Pena, Laura; Jimenez-Guerrero, Pedro] Univ Murcia, Dept Phys, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Im, Ulas; Geels, Camilla] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Jimenez-Guerrero, Pedro] Biomed Res Inst Murcia IMIB Arrixaca, Murcia 30120, Spain; [Palacios-Pena, Laura] Meteored, Dept Meteorol, Almendricos 30893, Spain",University of Murcia; Aarhus University; Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca,"Jimenez-Guerrero, P (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Phys, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia 30100, Spain.",pedro.jimenezguerrero@um.es,"Tarín-Carrasco, Patricia/ABE-9086-2021; Jimenez-Guerrero, Pedro/L-2149-2014; Geels, Camilla/G-4757-2013; Palacios-Pena, Laura/K-6619-2017","Tarín-Carrasco, Patricia/0000-0001-7101-0554; Jimenez-Guerrero, Pedro/0000-0002-3156-0671; Geels, Camilla/0000-0003-2549-1750; Palacios-Pena, Laura/0000-0001-5577-6840",Spanish Ministry of the Economyand Competitiveness/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER grant) [ACEX-CGL2017-87921-R]; Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition (Fundacion Biodiversidad); EXHAUSTION project,Spanish Ministry of the Economyand Competitiveness/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER grant); Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition (Fundacion Biodiversidad); EXHAUSTION project,This study was supported by the Spanish Ministry of the Economyand Competitiveness/Agencia Estatal de Investigacion and the European Regional Development Fund through ACEX-CGL2017-87921-R project (ERDF/FEDER grant) .

Countries can meet their mitigation commitments and environmental objectives through multiple instruments. A key role is played by cooperative mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), under the Kyoto Protocol, and a similar mechanism established by the Paris Agreement (Art. 6), whose implementation rules are still under negotiation. However, another form of cooperation was already established under the different framework of the Official Development Assistance (ODA), potentially sharing abatement purposes. This paper aims to compare the mitigation actions implemented either as CDM or ODA projects. We conduct a multi-criteria econometric analysis, based on an originally created, harmonised dataset that merges renewable energy CDM projects and comparable ODA projects to investigate the role of the institutional framework in influencing the effectiveness of reducing emissions worldwide. Results show that the Kyoto Protocol had a positive impact in terms of cost-effectiveness for renewable energy projects and that it stimulated policy actions for environmental sustainability. Accordingly, in view of the implementation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, it is extremely important both to look to the past to draw lessons from Kyoto's successes and failures and to apply multi-criteria decision-making approaches for the design of environmental policies.",,,,antonio.mele@fao.org,,,,,,,57,5,5,13,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0038-0121,1873-6041,,SOCIO-ECON PLAN SCI,Socio-Econ.

The monsoon depression lasted similar to 10 days, driving daily rainfall accumulations exceeding 200 mm/day, maximum temperatures 8-10 degrees C below normal, and wind gusts above 70 km/h. In this study, the atmospheric conditions during the event and its predictability on the weekly to subseasonal range are investigated. Results show that during the event, the tropical convective signal of the Madden-Julian Oscillation was over the western Pacific, and likely contributed to the heavy rainfall, however the El Nino-Southern Oscillation was not in the usual phase for increased rainfall over Queensland. Over the northern Tasman Sea, an anticyclone helped maintain a positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode and promote onshore easterly flow. Somewhat consistent with these climate drivers, the monthly rainfall outlook for February issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on 31 January provided no indication of the event, yet forecasts, not available to the public, of weekly-averaged conditions by the Bureau's dynamical subseasonal-toseasonal (S2S) prediction system were more successful. For the week of 31 January to 6 February the prediction system forecast a more than doubling of the probability of extreme (highest quintile) weekly rainfall a week prior to the event, along with increased probabilities of extremely low (lowest quintile) maximum temperatures and extreme (highest quintile) wind speeds. Ensemble-mean weekly rainfall amounts, however, were considerably underestimated by the prediction system, even in forecasts initialised at the start of the peak flooding week, consistent with other state-of-the-art dynamical S2S prediction systems. Despite this, one of the individual ensemble members of the Bureau's prediction system did manage to forecast close to 85% of the magnitude of the rainfall across the most heavily impacted region of northwest Queensland a week before the event. Predicting this exceptional event beyond two weeks appears beyond our current capability despite the dynamical system forecasts showing good skill in forecasting the broad-scale atmospheric conditions north of Australia a week prior.","[Cowan, T.; Jarvis, C.; Cobon, D.

This uncertainty presents a challenge for projecting future climate-carbon cycle feedbacks(1-4). Terrestrial carbon storage is dependent on the availability of nitrogen for plant growth(5-8), and nitrogen limitation is increasingly included in global models(9-11). Widespread phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems(12) may also strongly regulate the global carbon cycle(13-15), but explicit considerations of phosphorus limitation in global models are uncommon(16). Here we use global state-of-the-art coupled carbon-climate model projections of terrestrial net primary productivity and carbon storage from 1860-2100; estimates of annual new nutrient inputs from deposition, nitrogen fixation, and weathering; and estimates of carbon allocation and stoichiometry to evaluate how simulated CO2 fertilization effects could be constrained by nutrient availability. We find that the nutrients required for the projected increases in net primary productivity greatly exceed estimated nutrient supply rates, suggesting that projected productivity increases may be unrealistically high. Accounting for nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus limitation lowers projected end-of-century estimates of net primary productivity by 19% and 25%, respectively, and turns the land surface into a net source of CO2 by 2100. We conclude that potential effects of nutrient limitation must be considered in estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink strength through the twenty-first century.","[Wieder, William R.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wieder, William R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Cleveland, Cory C.; Smith, W.

The analysis is performed for present-day conditions ( year 2000) and for two future ship emission scenarios. In one scenario ship emissions stabilize at 2000 levels; in the other ship emissions increase with a constant annual growth rate of 2.2% up to 2030 ( termed the Constant Growth Scenario (CGS)). Most other anthropogenic emissions follow the IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) SRES ( Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A2 scenario, while biomass burning and natural emissions remain at year 2000 levels. An intercomparison of the model results with observations over the Northern Hemisphere (25 degrees - 60 degrees N) oceanic regions in the lower troposphere showed that the models are capable to reproduce ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO+ NO2) reasonably well, whereas sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the marine boundary layer is significantly underestimated. The most pronounced changes in annual mean tropospheric NO2 and sulphate columns are simulated over the Baltic and North Seas. Other significant changes occur over the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and along the main shipping lane from Europe to Asia, across the Red and Arabian Seas. Maximum contributions from shipping to annual mean near-surface O-3 are found over the North Atlantic ( 5 - 6 ppbv in 2000; up to 8 ppbv in 2030). Ship contributions to tropospheric O3 columns over the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans reach 1 DU in 2000 and up to 1.8 DU in 2030. Tropospheric O-3 forcings due to shipping are 9.8 +/- 2.0 mW/m(2) in 2000 and 13.6 +/- 2.3 mW/m(2) in 2030. Whilst increasing O-3, ship NOx simultaneously enhances hydroxyl radicals over the remote ocean, reducing the global methane lifetime by 0.13 yr in 2000, and by up to 0.17 yr in 2030, introducing a negative radiative forcing. The models show future increases in NOx and O-3 burden which scale almost linearly with increases in NOx emission totals. Increasing emissions from shipping would significantly counteract the benefits derived from reducing SO2 emissions from all other anthropogenic sources under the A2 scenario over the continents, for example in Europe. Globally, shipping contributes 3% to increases in O-3 burden between 2000 and 2030, and 4.5% to increases in sulphate under A2/CGS. However, if future ground based emissions follow a more stringent scenario, the relative importance of ship emissions will increase. Inter-model differences in the simulated O-3 contributions from ships are significantly smaller than estimated uncertainties stemming from the ship emission inventory, mainly the ship emission totals, the distribution of the emissions over the globe, and the neglect of ship plume dispersion.","DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ispra, Italy; Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany; Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway; Lab Sci Climat Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; Univ Bremen, Inst Environm Phys, Bremen, Germany; Goddard Earth Sci & Technol Ctr, Washington, DC USA; JAMSTEC, Frontier Res Ctr Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, NL-3730 AE De Bilt, Netherlands",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); University of Edinburgh; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; University of Oslo; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Bremen; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute,"Eyring, V (corresponding author), DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.",Veronika.Eyring@dlr.de,"Strahan, Susan E/H-1965-2012; Rodriguez, Jose/G-3751-2013; Ellingsen, Kjerstin/AAV-5047-2021; Richter, Andreas/C-4971-2008; Hauglustaine, Didier/A-4154-2012; Collins, William/A-5895-2010; SZOPA, Sophie/F-8984-2010; Eyring, Veronika/O-9999-2016; Stevenson, David S/C-8089-2012; Sudo, Kengo/I-6394-2014; Wild, Oliver/A-4909-2009; Butler, Tim/G-1139-2011","Strahan, Susan E/0000-0002-7511-4577; Rodriguez, Jose/0000-0002-1902-4649; Richter, Andreas/0000-0003-3339-212X; Hauglustaine, Didier/0000-0002-4826-5118; Collins, William/0000-0002-7419-0850; SZOPA, Sophie/0000-0002-8641-1737; Eyring, Veronika/0000-0002-6887-4885; Stevenson, David S/0000-0002-4745-5673; Sudo, Kengo/0000-0002-5013-4168; Wild, Oliver/0000-0002-6227-7035; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0002-2178-4903; Butler, Timothy/0000-0002-2219-4657",,,,,71,92,94,6,38,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Uncertainties exist regarding the climatic response to strong volcanic forcing identified in coupled climate simulations that contributed to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In order to better understand the sources of these model diversities, the Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP) has defined a coordinated set of idealized volcanic perturbation experiments to be carried out in alignment with the CMIP6 protocol. VolMIP provides a common stratospheric aerosol data set for each experiment to minimize differences in the applied volcanic forcing. It defines a set of initial conditions to assess how internal climate variability contributes to determining the response. VolMIP will assess to what extent volcanically forced responses of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system are robustly simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate models and identify the causes that limit robust simulated behavior, especially differences in the treatment of physical processes. This paper illustrates the design of the idealized volcanic perturbation experiments in the VolMIP protocol and describes the common aerosol forcing input data sets to be used.","[Zanchettin, Davide; Rubino, Angelo] Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy; [Khodri, Myriam; Poulain, Virginie] IRD IPSL Lab Oceanog & Climat, Paris, France; [Timmreck, Claudia; Toohey, Matthew; Niemeier, Ulrike] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Toohey, Matthew] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Anja; Dhomse, Sandip S.; Mann, Graham W.; Marshall, Lauren] Univ Leeds, Inst Climate & Atmospher Sci, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Gerber, Edwin P.] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY USA; [Hegerl, Gabriele] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Robock, Alan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Pausata, Francesco S.

It is shown that some state-of-the-art climate models are unable to correctly simulate the physical processes connected to the NAO. This is especially true for models with a strongly underestimated frequency of high-latitude blocking over Greenland. In these models the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) of the Euro-Atlantic sector can represent at least three different categories of dominant modes of variability associated with different prevalent regions of blocking occurrence and jet stream displacements. It is therefore possible to show that such biased NAOs are connected with different dynamical processes with respect to the canonical NAO seen in observations. Since the NAO is a widely used concept in scientific community, the consequent dynamical misinterpretation of the NAO that can result when climate models are analyzed may have important implications for the NAO-related studies. This may be especially relevant for the ones involving climate scenarios, since these modeled NAOs may react differently to greenhouse gas forcing.","[Cagnazzo, Chiara] CNR, ISAC, Rome, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR),"Davini, P (corresponding author), CNR, ISAC, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy.",p.davini@isac.cnr.it,"Davini, Paolo/A-8996-2018; Cagnazzo, Chiara/C-7194-2015","Davini, Paolo/0000-0003-3389-7849; cagnazzo, chiara/0000-0002-2054-0448","Project of Strategic Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)","Project of Strategic Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work has been funded by the Project of Strategic Interest NextData of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) (http://www.nextdataproject.it).",,47,66,66,0,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Kilimanjaro-Mountain National Park was specifically designated to protect and safeguard the highest free-standing mountain in the tropics. The park attracts thousands of national and international tourists annually because of its snow capped-summit and the altitudinal gradients, representing the different eco-climatic zones of the world. Earnings from tourism boost the country's economy while ensuring the sustainability of this unique glacial-tropical mountainous forest ecosystem park. Conventional monitoring of key biodiversity and environmental parameters are carried out by park staff, following established guidelines by Tanzania National Parks. However, given the park's geo-morphological nature of mountainous terrain, efficient implementations of the labor intensive in-situ observations are hardly feasible. This research explored the use of Remote Sensing data from the European Satellite Agency-Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument, in developing a state-of-the-art monitoring protocol.

First, we review the cultural and social construction of urbanity (as related to urbanization) in Germany. In the early 20th century, urbanity was mainly the result of identity derived from a historical perspective in cities. This has changed profoundly in recent decades as urbanity stems more and more from various urban lifestyles and the staging of societal experiences, as summarized in the German term, Erlebnisgesellschaft(thrill-seeking society). The discussion is extended by an assessment of the recent state of the art regarding physical urban research. The focus lies on different fields of research; we address topics such as biodiversity, urban climate, air pollution, and resilience, as well as their impact on urban planning and governance. In conclusion, in order to tackle recent developments and future challenges regarding social and environmental issues, an integrative approach urges novel cross-and inter-disciplinary research efforts in urban studies, including urban-rural linkages. A newly constituted assessment of urbanization and city quarter development is proposed; the assessment focuses on the conjoint analysis of mobility, Energiewende(energy transition), cultural drivers, demographic development, and environmental issues.","[Schneider, Christoph; Merbitz, Hendrik] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Geog, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Achilles, Bianca] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Human Technol Ctr, Theaterplatz 14, D-52062 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University,"Schneider, C (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Geog, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",christoph.schneider@geo.rwth-aachen.de; achilles@humtec.rwth-aachen.de; hendrik.merbitz@geo.rwth-aachen.de,"Schneider, Christoph/V-2150-2017","Schneider, Christoph/0000-0002-9914-3217",Excellence Initiative of the German federal government through HumTec at RWTH Aachen University; Excellence Initiative of the German state government through HumTec at RWTH Aachen University; Geoverbund ABC/J; Alliance of Geoscience Research Unit at the University of Aachen; Alliance of Geoscience Research Unit at the University of Bonn; Alliance of Geoscience Research Unit at the University of Cologne; Forschungszentrum Julich,Excellence Initiative of the German federal government through HumTec at RWTH Aachen University; Excellence Initiative of the German state government through HumTec at RWTH Aachen University; Geoverbund ABC/J; Alliance of Geoscience Research Unit at the University of Aachen; Alliance of Geoscience Research Unit at the University of Bonn; Alliance of Geoscience Research Unit at the University of Cologne; Forschungszentrum Julich(Helmholtz Association),"This work has been funded by the Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments through the project house, HumTec, at RWTH Aachen University and a grant from the Geoverbund ABC/J, the Alliance of Geoscience Research Units at the Universities of Aachen, Bonn, and Cologne and the Forschungszentrum Julich.

The dynamics of glaciers in Karakoram are complex, and in recent decades the area has experienced unchanged ice cover, despite rapid decline elsewhere in the world (the Karakoram anomaly). Assessment of future water resources and hydrological variability under climate change in this area is greatly needed, but the hydrology of these high-altitude catchments is still poorly studied and little understood. This study focuses on a particular watershed, the Shigar River with the control section at Shigar (about 7000 km(2)), nested within the upper Indus basin and fed by seasonal melt from two major glaciers (Baltoro and Biafo). Hydrological, meteorological, and glaciological data gathered during 3 years of field campaigns (2011-13) are used to set up a hydrological model, providing a depiction of instream flows, snowmelt, and ice cover thickness. The model is used to assess changes of the hydrological cycle until 2100, via climate projections provided by three state-of-the-art global climate models used in the recent IPCC Fifth Assessment Report under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) emission scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Under all RCPs, future flows are predicted to increase until midcentury and then to decrease, but remaining mostly higher than control run values. Snowmelt is projected to occur earlier, while the ice melt component is expected to increase, with ice thinning considerably and even disappearing below 4000 m MSL until 2100.","[Soncini, Andrea; Bocchiola, Daniele; Confortola, Gabriele; Bianchi, Alberto; Rosso, Renzo] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Bocchiola, Daniele] Ev K2 CNR Assoc, Bergamo, Italy; [Mayer, Christoph; Lambrecht, Astrid] Bavarian Acad Sci, Munich, Germany; [Palazzi, Elisa] CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Turin, Italy; [Smiraglia, Claudio; Diolaiuti, Guglielmina] Univ Milan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR); University of Milan,"Bocchiola, D (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",daniele.bocchiola@polimi.it,"Soncini, Andrea/K-7127-2013; palazzi, elisa/C-7048-2015; SONCINI, ANDREA/P-2934-2019; Diolaiuti, Guglielmina/A-9422-2008","Soncini, Andrea/0000-0001-9011-616X; palazzi, elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; SONCINI, ANDREA/0000-0001-9011-616X; Diolaiuti, Guglielmina/0000-0002-3883-9309; CONFORTOLA, GABRIELE/0000-0002-5443-0589; Rosso, Renzo/0000-0003-1062-1911; Mayer, Christoph/0000-0002-4226-4608; Smiraglia, Claudio/0000-0001-6635-2074",Ev-K2-CNR Association of Italy,Ev-K2-CNR Association of Italy,"The present work was carried out at the conclusion of the SHARE-PAPRIKA project, funded by the Ev-K2-CNR Association of Italy, aimed at evaluating the impact of climate change on hydrology of the upper Indus River.

Part II: Comparison with North American Regional Reanalysis,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; TEMPERATURE TRENDS; CATALINA EDDY; SURFACE; SATELLITE; PROJECT; CLIMATE,"The California Reanalysis Downscaling at 10 km (CaRD10) was compared with the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), which is a data assimilation regional analysis at 32-km resolution and 3-hourly output using the Eta Model for the period 1979 through the present using the NCEP/Department of Energy (DOE) reanalysis as lateral boundary conditions. The objectives of this comparison are twofold: 1) to understand the efficacy of regional downscaling and horizontal resolution and 2) to estimate the uncertainties in regional analyses due to system differences. The large-scale component of atmospheric analysis is similar in CaRD10 and NARR. The CaRD10 daily winds fit better to station observations than NARR over ocean where daily variability is large and over land. The daily near-surface temperature comparison shows a similar temporal correlation with observations in CaRD10 and NARR. Several synoptic examples such as the Catalina eddy, coastally trapped wind reversal, and Santa Ana winds are better produced in CaRD10 than NARR. These suggest that the horizontal resolution of the model has a large influence on the regional analysis, and the near-surface observation is not properly assimilated in the current state-of-the-art regional data assimilation system. The CaRD10 near-surface temperature and winds on monthly and hourly scales are similar to NARR with more regional details available in CaRD10. The Southwestern monsoon is poorly reproduced in CaRD10 because of the position of the lateral boundary. The spatial pattern of the two precipitation analyses is similar, but CaRD10 shows smaller-scale features despite a positive bias. The trends of 500-hPa height and precipitation are similar in the two analyses but the near-surface temperature trend spatial patterns do not agree, suggesting the importance of regional topography, model physics, and land surface schemes. A comparison of a major storm event shows that both analyses suffer from budget residual. CaRD10's large precipitation is related to wind direction, spatial distribution of precipitable water, and a large moisture convergence. Dynamical downscaling forced by a global analysis is a computationally economical approach to regionalscale long-term climate analysis and can provide a high-quality climate analysis comparable to current state-of-the-art data-assimilated regional reanalysis. However, uncertainties in regional analyses can be large and caution should be exercised when using them for climate applications.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Kanamaru, H (corresponding author), UCSD, SIO, CRD, Mail Code 0224, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",hkanamaru@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,23,46,47,0,5,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,,,J CLIMATE,J.

Accounting for the high uncertainty, risks, and irreversibility of CCS projects, a growing number of studies apply the real options (RO) approaches which allow flexibility in the valuation of uncertain investment. Various RO models and valuation techniques are adopted and the critical analysis of the research trends and research hotspots in RO designs in CCS investments has not been made yet. This study employs a bibliometric analysis to examine the features of CCS literature including the research focus and trends as well RO uncertainty and models, types of options, and valuation techniques. The results present a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art which provides researchers a concrete basis for future research and directions for further development. This further provides energy and environmental policymakers and CCS project planners with valuable insights on various aspects of CCS policy and project design. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

The certification of companies according to the standard ISO 50001:2011 (Energy management systems Requirements and guidelines for use), can represent a key element in the achievement of objectives set in the 20-20-20 Climate-Energy Package. This paper illustrates the state of implementation of ISO 50001 certifications in Italy, reporting on the results of a questionnaire carried out as a part of a master's thesis project at Sapienza, University of Rome in collaboration with FIRE (Italian Federation for the Rational Use of Energy) that included the major certification bodies, certified companies and consultants. The purpose is to outline the current situation, identify the perspectives and highlight the pros and cons related to the implementation of an Energy Management System (EnMS). The big picture shows that Italy, one of the leading countries in energy efficiency policies, suffer from a significant delay in the implementation of the EnMS in industry with respect to Germany. The results of the survey also show that the definition of energy performance indicators, as hell as the individuations of an energy baseline and a. monitoring plan constitute the requirements most critical to comply with for companies than for consultants. It also appears that more than 35% of companies already ISO 50001 certified have received benefits in terms of cumulative energy saving above 5%, and that the main reason why they have implemented an EnMS is related to the potential impact on increasing the competitiveness of the core business.

Therefore, the present analysis proves the special quality and inevitable ephemeral status of this project, for it constitutes a multimodal and multimedia web-archive, subject to possible erasure, or obsolescence in the face of new computer programmes and platforms developments. The archive is also an open instrument for everybody's use: a digital audio-visual (poetic) dictionary, that ultimately functions as a challenge to climate change effects, that might dissolve both the ice formations and the language that accompanies them.

Hazardous materials, harmful substances and radiation may lead to severe diseases. Slippery floors and stairs may cause fall accidents. In industrial plants, ill-considered production processes and poorly designed machines may even kill people. Therefore H&S are relevant values in themselves, but they also have an impact on other values such as productivity, employee satisfaction, Corporate Social Responsibility, sustainability, profitability and risk. This chapter presents state of the art FM/CREM related research on H&S, with a focus on the indoor climate and workplace layout. It also presents the benefits and costs of various interventions to improve H&S.

These methods are generally geared for heat, air and moisture (HAM) modeling and involve selecting a reference year. Whereas the real climate of the reference year can be followed in simulations, the loading has to be simplified in an experiment. To set deterministic or quasi-stochastic loads for experimental testing, the climatic variables can be statistically analyzed. However the reference year does not provide information in terms of wind-driven rain infiltration loading. As well, since in an experiment the water must be inserted physically, two more steps are required to determine the load conditions: the water insertion rate must be established as well as the method of water introduction. This paper presents various existing methods for selecting a climate-representative reference year and their limited applicability for experimental testing. Methods to determine the impinging wind-driven rain on building facades are discussed, as well as previous work on wind-driven rain infiltration and methods used for the experimental simulation of wind-driven rain infiltration. The findings from the literature review show that there is a need for the development of a methodology to simulate wind-driven rain infiltration that takes into consideration climatic variables, such as rainfall and wind speed, as well as building geometry, location on a facade, and an estimate of wind-driven rain infiltration rates in the context of building envelope testing.","Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Ctr Bldg Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Teasdale-St-Hilaire, A (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Ctr Bldg Studies, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,"Derome, Dominique/0000-0002-8018-1133",,,,,45,5,5,0,2,"AMER SOC HEATING, REFRIGERATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING ENGS",ATLANTA,"1791 TULLIE CIRCLE NE, ATLANTA, GA 30329 USA",0001-2505,,,ASHRAE TRAN,,,2005,,2,,,389,401,,,,,,13,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,BDP17,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000234678400036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Walliser to refer to unique facies typical of particular narrow intervals, some of which were related to bioevents. In some senses, however, the concept was recognized much earlier and is even engrained in the very names of some geologic periods. The concept of time-specific facies is expanded slightly herein to include distinctive or unique regional to global characteristics of the sedimentary record that characterize particular intervals of geologic time. The recognition of time-specific and widespread processes in the sedimentary record is a critical step in unraveling the interplay between processes of differing scale. These range from very short-term, but widespread facies that overlap with event deposits, to general fades types that may persist for intervals up to 10s of millions of years in duration. This paper briefly summarizes the history of development of the TSF concept, provides examples to illustrate a few of the key aspects of time-specific facies and offers a few tentative explanations for this phenomenon. Among the factors that control TSFs, abrupt changes in redox conditions and early diagenetic mineralization, sedimentary condensation, often associated with abrupt sea level change, altered climate and paleoceanography, and biotic evolution and extinction seem to be most critical and permit a preliminary genetic classification of TSFs. Inevitably, however, many TSFs reflect multiple effects and some remain largely unexplained. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While resources from international organizations and national authorities occupy a prominent position in adaptation funding, the use of local resources that directly or indirectly support adaptation practices is also an important factor to consider. We hypothesize that it is that interplay between official climate change finance on the one hand and local social dynamics on the other hand that shapes the structure of adaptation funding. These very particular financing circuits consequently determine the kind of adaptation actions that are actually implemented. The paper unfolds the adaptation finance flows at all scales by using qualitative field studies, technical and legal reports, and a wide-ranging literature on adaptation project financing, and thus identifies three types of dialectical tensions that might hinder Vietnamese institutional readiness for adaptation finance: the adaptation/development financing nexus, the adaptation/reaction financing behaviors, and the endogenous/exogenous financing dichotomy. Ultimately, the paper derives from these dialectical tensions within the architecture and functioning of adaptation finance key takeaway messages for a prospective analysis of adaptation funding that better informs adaptation finance policies.","[Pannier, Emmanuel] French Natl Res Inst Sustainable Dev IRD, Res Unit Local Heritage Environm & Globalizat, F-75006 Paris, France; [Vu, Toan Canh] Inst Social & Environm Transit ISET, Hanoi 10000, Vietnam; [Espagne, Etienne] Agence Francaise Dev, Res Dept, F-75012 Paris, France; [Pulliat, Gwenn] French Natl Ctr Sci Res, CNRS, Res Unit ART Dev, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Nguyen, Thi Thu Ha] Univ Rouen, LASTA, F-76000 Rouen, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Espagne, E (corresponding author), Agence Francaise Dev, Res Dept, F-75012 Paris, France.",emmanuel.pannier@ird.fr; toanvu@i-s-e-t.org; espagnee@afd.fr; gwenn.pulliat@cnrs.fr; hanguyencerdi@gmail.com,,"Pulliat, Gwenn/0000-0003-2649-5614",French Agency for Development (AFD); French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) through the GEMMES-Vietnam project,French Agency for Development (AFD)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) through the GEMMES-Vietnam project,This research was funded by French Agency for Development (AFD) and French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) through the GEMMES-Vietnam project.,,70,1,1,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,18,,,,,,7691,10.3390/su12187691,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187691,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OJ9EP,,"gold, Green Published",,,12/21/22,WOS:000584256800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response to reducing the global warming impact of MACs, policy makers and the industry are investigating alternative refrigerant systems that use low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. The GREEN-MAC-LCCP model assesses the direct and indirect CO2 equivalent emissions related to MACs usage, as well as those associated with the production, use and disposal of alternative refrigerants and MACs components. This model provides a platform for simple data input and provides an output summary as well as details that can be analyzed in a custom fashion by the user. It provides engineers and policy makers a state-of-the-art tool, based on sound engineering data and methods, in order to facilitate the process of evaluating alternate refrigerants with low lifecycle global warming impact as well as providing the total impact of any MACs on the environment It has been recognized as the standard of the MACs industry.","[Papasavva, Stella; Hill, William R.] Gen Motors, Gen Motors R&D, HVAC Prod Dev, Warren, MI 48090 USA; [Andersen, Stephen O.] Environm Protect Agcy, Barnard, VT 05031 USA",General Motors; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Papasavva, S (corresponding author), Stella Papasavva Consulting, Royal Oak, MI 48073 USA.",greengem09@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,27,28,0,13,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

The analysis also updates earlier estimates of the potential predictability of temperature to provide a consistent estimate for these basic climate parameters. Long timescale potential predictability is found mainly over the oceans at middle to high latitudes and predominantly where the surface is connected to the deeper ocean. Precipitation's modest potential predictability resembles an attenuated version of that for temperature on these timescales. Over land, predictability is largely absent for precipitation and comparatively weak for temperature where it is found over the northern and western parts of northern hemisphere land masses bordering the oceans. Regions exhibiting potential predictability indicate where we may hope to find predictive skill at long timescales and also points indirectly to the processes involved. Citation: Boer, G. J., and S.

This is particularly challenging in the tropical Pacific Ocean, where short, sparse instrumental data preclude GCM validation on multidecadal to centennial time scales. This two-part paper demonstrates the application of two statistical methodologies to a network of accurately dated tropical climate records to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the Nino-3.4 region over the past millennium. While Part I described the methods and established their validity and limitations, this paper presents several reconstructions of Nino-3.4, analyzes their sensitivity to procedural choices and input data, and compares them to climate forcing time series and previously published tropical Pacific SST reconstructions. The reconstructions herein show remarkably similar behavior at decadal to multidecadal scales, but diverge markedly on centennial scales. The amplitude of centennial variability in each reconstruction scales with the magnitude of the A. D. 1860-1995 trend in the target dataset's Nino-3.4 index, with Extended Reconstructed SST, version 3 (ERSSTv3) > the Second Hadley Centre SST dataset (HadSST2) > Kaplan SST; these discrepancies constitute a major source of uncertainty in reconstructing preinstrumental Nino-3.4 SST. Despite inevitable variance losses, the reconstructed multidecadal variability exceeds that simulated by a state-of-the-art GCM (forced and unforced) over the past millennium, while reconstructed centennial variability is incompatible with constant boundary conditions. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals a robust antiphasing between solar forcing and Nino-3.4 SST on bicentennial time scales, but not on shorter time scales. Implications for GCM representations of the tropical Pacific climate response to radiative forcing are then discussed.","[Emile-Geay, Julien] Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Cobb, Kimberly M.] Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Mann, Michael E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wittenberg, Andrew T.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA",University of Southern California; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Emile-Geay, J (corresponding author), Univ So Calif, Dept Earth Sci, 3651 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",julieneg@usc.edu,"Mann, Michael E/B-8472-2017; Wittenberg, Andrew T/G-9619-2013; Emile-Geay, Julien/B-1102-2010","Mann, Michael E/0000-0003-3067-296X; Wittenberg, Andrew T/0000-0003-1680-8963; Emile-Geay, Julien/0000-0001-5920-4751; Cobb, Kim/0000-0002-2125-9164",NOAA [NA06OAR4310116],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We acknowledge funding from NOAA Grant NA06OAR4310116.

Caught up in the scramble for the Arctic, Alaska is directly affected by climate change, but the state's vastness also forms a metaphor for the tremendous challenges our ecological crisis puts before us: the sublime landscape forms an Anthropocenic archive of human activity, and its scalar vastness and unmappability challenge human imagination. This essay questions the rhetorical utopianism and idealism about the planetary consciousness apparently generated by new technology, showing that art and literature argue for a sober, pragmatic approach to our crisis in scaling up our imagination. After tracing traditional Alaskan mythologies, I show how contemporary eco-memoirs test and challenge humanist dogmas. The Big Data project, I Love Alaska, and the cinematographic exploration of AI and human evolution, Ex Machina, also point beyond humanism and posit Alaska as a potent imaginary space where anti-anthropocentric ideas, the changing relationship between humans and nature, and the potential of a planetary consciousness/memory can be explored. Both paths demand posthuman subjectivities that stretch, or perhaps overstretch, the limits of the human imagination.","[Groes, Sebastian] Univ Roehampton, Dept English & Creat Writing, London, England",Roehampton University,"Groes, S (corresponding author), Univ Roehampton, Dept English & Creat Writing, London, England.",sebastian.groes@roehampton.ac.uk,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/J005894/1] Funding Source: researchfish; AHRC [AH/J005894/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),,,35,1,1,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-236X,1470-1308,,TEXTUAL PRACT,Textual Pract.,,2017,5,,,,973,993,,10.1080/0950236X.2017.1323492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0950236X.2017.1323492,,,21,Literature,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Literature,EY2FP,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000403784300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To attract interest and more investment from industry players into biomass-based industries, comprehensive techno-economic analysis has to be performed. In addition, various uncertainties related to supply chain such as biomass attainability, demand variation, and material price fluctuation, have to be considered in the evaluation to yield more accurate and reliable feasibility estimation. This review paper aims to: (i) provide an overview on the different types of methods or approaches used in the feasibility evaluation of biomass-based industries from the techno-economic point of view, and (ii) outline the supply chain uncertainties that should be incorporated into the evaluation model using a Malaysian case study to illustrate the impact of these uncertainties. Apart from that, some of the unquantifiable uncertainties and risks are critically reviewed in this paper. It was found that 78 % of the reviewed articles opted for mathematical modelling evaluation method with the majority leaning towards mathematical modelling with optimization (i.e., deterministic and stochastic optimization). Furthermore, only a minority had performed stochastic evaluation that incorporates biomass supply chain uncertainties. This review discussed six quantifiable uncertainties, include: (i) biomass availability, (ii) biomass quality, (iii) transportation cost, (iv) market demand, (v) fluctuation of pricing, and (vi) wages of workers.","[Lo, Shirleen Lee Yuen; How, Bing Shen; Sunarso, Jaka] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia; [Leong, Wei Dong] Univ Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia; [Teng, Sin Yong] Brno Univ Technol, Inst Proc Engn, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic; [Teng, Sin Yong] Brno Univ Technol, NETME Ctr, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic; [Rhamdhani, Muhammad Akbar] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Mech & Prod Design Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak; Brno University of Technology; Brno University of Technology; Swinburne University of Technology,"How, BS (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Engn Comp & Sci, Res Ctr Sustainable Technol, Jalan Simpang Tiga, Sarawak 93350, Malaysia.",shirleenloleeyuen@gmail.com; bshow@swinburne.edu.my; leongweidong@gmail.com; Sin.Yong.Teng@vut.cz; ARhamdhani@swin.edu.au; jsunarso@swinburne.edu.my,"Sunarso, Jaka/B-9077-2008; how, bing shen/L-2469-2019; Rhamdhani, Muhammad Akbar/ACM-2274-2022; Teng, Sin Yong/V-3902-2019","Sunarso, Jaka/0000-0002-5234-7431; how, bing shen/0000-0002-0969-9167; Rhamdhani, Muhammad Akbar/0000-0002-9457-3808; Teng, Sin Yong/0000-0002-2988-8053","Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus [9-1372 RMFST, 2-5545 RSG]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE grant [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413]","Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic under OP RDE grant","S.L.Y.

Here, we present preindustrial and historical results from the newly released Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) to assess the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. Two configurations of the CESM2 are available that differ only in their atmospheric model top and the inclusion of comprehensive atmospheric chemistry, including prognostic aerosols. The CESM2 configuration with comprehensive atmospheric chemistry has significantly thicker Arctic sea ice year-round and better captures decreasing trends in sea ice extent and volume over the satellite period. In the Antarctic, both CESM configurations have similar mean state ice extent and volume, but the ice extent trends are opposite to satellite observations. We find that differences in the Arctic sea ice between CESM2 configurations are the result of differences in liquid clouds. Over the Arctic, the CESM2 configuration without prognostic aerosol formation has fewer aerosols to form cloud condensation nuclei, leading to thinner liquid clouds. As a result, the sea ice receives much more shortwave radiation early in the melt season, driving a stronger ice albedo feedback and leading to additional sea ice loss and significantly thinner ice year-round. The aerosols necessary for the Arctic liquid cloud formation are produced from different precursor emissions and transported to the Arctic. Thus, the main reason sea ice differs in the Arctic is the transport of cloud-impacting aerosols into the region, while the Antarctic remains relatively pristine from extrapolar aerosol transport. Plain Language Summary Arctic and Antarctic sea ice has undergone significant and rapid change with the changing climate. Here we assess Arctic and Antarctic sea ice in a new state-of-the-art Earth System Model, the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2). In particular, we explore how the atmosphere impacts the sea ice. When the CESM2 model does not include chemistry of particles in the atmosphere, we find that Arctic clouds are thinner, which allows more sunlight to reach the sea ice at the surface in the spring and summer. As a result, the sea ice melts more so that it covers less of the Arctic Ocean surface and is overall thinner than in CESM2 simulations that do include chemistry of particles. In contrast, inclusion or lack of particle chemistry does not lead to large differences in the Antarctic sea ice thickness or surface area covered by sea ice. The reason for the opposite results in the hemispheres is that the particles that impact clouds are produced outside the Arctic and Antarctic. These particles are transported successfully to the Arctic, but the Antarctic remains relatively pristine from external particle transport.","[DuVivier, Alice K.; Holland, Marika M.; Tilmes, Simone; Gettelman, Andrew; Bailey, David A.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Kay, Jennifer E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kay, Jennifer E.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"DuVivier, AK (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",duvivier@ucar.edu,"Gettelman, Andrew/AAY-2312-2021; Kay, Jennifer/C-6042-2012","Kay, Jennifer/0000-0002-3625-5377; Tilmes, Simone/0000-0002-6557-3569; DUVIVIER, ALICE K./0000-0001-6920-5926; Bailey, David/0000-0002-6584-0663",National Science Foundation (NSF); National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - NSF [1852977]; NSF CAREER [1554659]; NSF [1724748],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - NSF; NSF CAREER(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The CESM project is supported primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, a comprehensive search of the literature was performed to identify studies published between January 1, 1998 and July 1, 2016 that focussed on structural school safety measures such as metal detectors, cameras, closed circuit television systems, and access control measures and/or school resource officers in primary and secondary schools. Only studies that relied on randomized controlled trials and pre-test/post-test designs evaluating the impact of at least one school safety measure in reference to a control condition were eligible for inclusion. Findings - The results of this exhaustive search revealed 32 unique study samples that met the inclusion criteria. Results from the studies suggest that implementation of more security measures may not be an effective policy. More safety measures often result in a decline of student-perceived safety. Study limitations and directions for future research are also discussed. Originality/value - Results from this meta-review can provide educational administrators, superintendents, and school safety policymakers with a synthesis of only the most rigorous and valid studies that evaluate the impact of school safety measures on both actual and perceived school-related delinquency and safety. This information will provide school safety decision makers with a state-of-the-art synthesis of how school safety measures impact school-related delinquency problems and safety, and which measures appear to be most effective for informing the allocation of scarce resources.","[Gonzalez, Jennifer M.

Given the environmental issues associated with cement production, geopolymer concrete has emerged as a sustainable construction material. Geopolymer concrete is an eco-friendly construction material that uses industrial or agricultural by-product ashes as the principal binder instead of Portland cement. Fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, rice husk ash, metakaolin, and palm oil fuel ash were all employed as binders in geopolymer concrete, with fly ash being the most frequent. The most important engineering property for all types of concrete composites, including geopolymer concrete, is the compressive strength. It is influenced by different parameters such as the chemical composition of the binder materials, alkaline liquid to binder ratio, extra water content, superplasticizers dosages, binder content, fine and coarse aggregate content, sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate content, the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, the concentration of sodium hydroxide (molarity), curing temperature, curing durations inside oven, and specimen ages. In order to demonstrate the effects of these varied parameters on the compressive strength of the fly ash-based geopolymer concrete, a comprehensive dataset of 800 samples was gathered and analyzed. According to the findings, the curing temperature, sodium silicate content, and alkaline solution to binder ratio are the most significant independent parameters influencing the compressive strength of the fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (FA-BGPC) composites.","[Ahmed, Hemn Unis; Mohammed, Azad A.; Rafiq, Serwan; Mohammed, Ahmed S.] Univ Sulaimani, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Sulaimaniyah 46001, Iraq; [Ahmed, Hemn Unis] Komar Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Sulaimaniyah 46001, Iraq; [Mosavi, Amir] Obuda Univ, Inst Software Design & Dev, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir] J Selye Univ, Dept Informat, Komarno 94501, Slovakia; [Mosavi, Amir] Univ Publ Serv, Inst Informat Soc, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; [Sor, Nadhim Hamah] Univ Garmian, Dept Civil Engn, Kalar 46021, Iraq; [Sor, Nadhim Hamah] Harran Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-63050 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Qaidi, Shaker M.

Quantification of these adverse impacts to coastal ecosystems is often done on a coarse scale of global regions. Consistent local scale estimates of physical impacts on ecosystems and monetary assessment of associated losses are scarce, especially in developing countries. With aim of facilitating such assessment, which is increasingly required, here we propose a coherent three-step framework and subsequently apply it to quantify potential sea level rise-driven alterations in the monetary value of ecosystem services in the coastal area of Semarang in Indonesia. Within this framework, we (1) quantify the present value of coastal ecosystem services by using economic valuation techniques; (2) identify the potential impacts of relative sea level rise (RSLR)-induced inundation on ecosystem services (for the year 2100 inundation scenarios); and (3) monetize these impacts by developing a novel scenario-based approach. The results show that full inundation (scenario A with 4 m RSLR) poses a median loss of 90% (US$ 2.8-3.5) and 25% (US$ 90 - 113) to the present art and fishery values per hectare, while amenity service is expected to lose upto 50% (US$ 3700 - 5400) of its present value. Additionally, recreation value of the coastal ecosystems in three selected sites (Marina and Maron beaches, and Plumbon estuary) will decrease by 70% (US$ 15,460 - 19,820) per hectare. However, in scenario B (RSLR of 1.1 m) with a 50% inundated area, these losses are estimated approximately 40% less than for scenario A. It is expected that researchers and policy makers may apply this approach in their areas of interest to gain a better understanding of the likely costs of sea level rise-driven environmental damages along coasts, ultimately contributing to the sustainable management of coastal environment in Indonesia and possibly in other developing countries.","[Mehvar, Seyedabdolhossein; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Mehvar, Seyedabdolhossein; Syukri, Ifdlol; Dastgheib, Ali; Ranasinghe, Roshanka] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Dept Water Sci & Engn, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Dept Governance & Technol Sustainabil, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sch Syst Management & Leadership, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Ranasinghe, Roshanka] Deltares, Harbour Coastal & Offshore Engn, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands",University of Twente; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education; University of Twente; University of Technology Sydney; Deltares,"Mehvar, S (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",s.mehvar@utwente.nl,"Ranasinghe, Roshanka/C-6711-2009; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016; Dastgheib, Ali/M-8982-2013","Ranasinghe, Roshanka/0000-0001-6234-2063; Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930; Dastgheib, Ali/0000-0002-5914-7213",AXA Research Fund; Ministry I&M-IHE Delft cooperation program; Deltares Strategic Research Programme 'Coastal and Offshore Engineering',AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); Ministry I&M-IHE Delft cooperation program; Deltares Strategic Research Programme 'Coastal and Offshore Engineering',Authors are thankful for the financial support from the AXA Research Fund and the Ministry I&M-IHE Delft cooperation program.

Accompanied this decrease in precipitation is weakened monsoon circulation featured by an anti-cyclonic circulation anomaly over the SCS in the later period relative to the early period. This work investigates impacts of anthropogenic forcing changes on this interdecadal change in observations, quantify the relative roles of greenhouse gases (GHG) forcing and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) forcing. A set of experiments is designed using the atmospheric component of a state-of-the-art climate model coupled to a multi-level mixed-layer ocean model forced with GHG concentrations and AA emissions in two periods. Modeling results indicate a dominant role of anthropogenic forcing on the observed interdecadal precipitation decrease and weakened monsoon circulation over the SCS in the late twentieth century in which AA forcing plays a more important role compared with GHG forcing. The mechanisms of GHG influences and AA induced changes are revealed by individual forcing experiments. Increasing GHG concentrations can suppress convection over the SCS summer monsoon region by warming the tropical Pacific with an El-Nino like sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, which is associated with a weakened Walker circulation. The changes in AA emissions, mainly through increases in emissions over Asia, lead to cool SST in the north Indian Ocean and the western North Pacific (WNP), and result in changes in meridional SST gradient over the tropical Indian Ocean and the WNP in pre-monsoon seasons. This anomalous meridional SST gradient leads to anomalous local Hadley circulation, characterized by anomalous ascents around the equator and descents over monsoon region, which suppresses convection over the SCS and reduces local precipitation.","[Lin, Zhongxi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Monsoon & Environm Res, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Dong, Buwen] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Wen, Zhiping] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wen, Zhiping] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lin, Zhongxi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Monsoon & Environm Res, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; Fudan University; Fudan University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Lin, ZX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Monsoon & Environm Res, Sch Atmospher Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Lin, ZX (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Monsoon & Environm Res, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.",linzhxi@mail2.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Projects of China [2016YFA0600601]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41530530, 41875087]; Sen Yat-Sen University (SYSU); U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading",National Key Research and Development Projects of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sen Yat-Sen University (SYSU); U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading,"This research is jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Projects of China (2016YFA0600601), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41530530, 41875087).

Recently, masked mycotoxins senso strictu, together with other covalently or non-covalently conjugated forms, even formed upon processing, have been classified as modified mycotoxins. In this context, the issue of modified fumonisins is of great interest, on account of the wide range of factors affecting their formation and accumulation in maize pre- and postharvest. Fumonisins, indeed, may undergo modification in plants, along the growing season, but also during storage and drying of maize kernels, and upon processing. All these modifications strongly affect the analytical outcome, thus making more difficult the assessment of maize compliance. Since the ratio between free and modified fumonisins is affected by maize composition and environmental factors, a deeper knowledge on the phenomena driving the production and accumulation of free and modified forms in plants may support the selection of resistant hybrids. This review provides a critical picture of the state of the art on this topic, mainly focusing on those events occurring in field, identified as crucial in determining amount and partitioning of contamination. Nevertheless, knowledge on modified fumonisins is still in its dawn, on account of the wide range of factors involved. Anyway, reported results, taking altogether, clearly indicate that modified fumonisins should be included in the monitoring plans to have an overview of the possible contribution to human exposure. Furthermore, next efforts should focus on the events occurring in field and on the cross-talk between the plant and the fungus, to support the identification of resistant hybrids and to provide data for predictive models, the most suitable tool to forecast what is going to happens in the future changing climate.","[Dall'Asta, C.] Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, Viale Sci 17-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Battilani, P.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Sustainable Crop Prod, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy",University of Parma; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Dall'Asta, C (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, Viale Sci 17-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy.",chiara.dallasta@unipr.it,"Dall'Asta, Chiara/C-3173-2008","Dall'Asta, Chiara/0000-0003-0716-8394",,,,,94,25,25,2,18,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1875-0710,1875-0796,,WORLD MYCOTOXIN J,World Mycotoxin J.,,2016,5,,SI,,727,739,,10.3920/WMJ2016.2058,http://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2016.2058,,,13,Food Science & Technology; Mycology; Toxicology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Food Science & Technology; Mycology; Toxicology,ED9OA,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000389200200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most clearly observed as temperature changes in Greenland ice-core records, their climatic imprint was geographically widespread. However, the temporal relation between DO events in Greenland and other regions is uncertain due to the chronological uncertainties of each archive, limiting our ability to test hypotheses of synchronous change. In contrast, the assumption of direct synchrony of climate changes forms the basis of many timescales. Here, we use cosmogenic radionuclides (Be-10, Cl-36, C-14) to link Greenland ice-core records to U/Th-dated speleothems, quantify offsets between the two timescales, and improve their absolute dating back to 45 000 years ago. This approach allows us to test the assumption that DO events occurred synchronously between Greenland ice-core and tropical speleothem records with unprecedented precision. We find that the onset of DO events occurs within synchronization uncertainties in all investigated records. Importantly, we demonstrate that local discrepancies remain in the temporal development of rapid climate change for specific events and speleothems. These may either be related to the location of proxy records relative to the shifting atmospheric fronts or to underestimated U/Th dating uncertainties. Our study thus highlights the potential for misleading interpretations of the Earth system when applying the common practice of climate wiggle matching.","[Adolphi, Florian; Erhardt, Tobias; Fischer, Hubertus] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Phys Inst, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Adolphi, Florian; Erhardt, Tobias; Fischer, Hubertus] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Adolphi, Florian; Muscheler, Raimund] Lund Univ, Dept Geol, Quaternary Sci, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Dyson Perrins Bldg,South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Edwards, R.

However, a comprehensive review of glacier changes and their impact on the hydrology of glacierised catchments for Switzerland is missing and we use the opportunity provided by the EU-FP7 ACQWA project to review the current state of knowledge about past changes and future projections. We examine the type of models that have been applied to infer glacier evolution and identify knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research in addition to those indicated in previous publications. Common characteristics in long-term series of projected future glacier runoff are an initial peak followed by a decline, associated with shifts in seasonality, earlier melt onset and reduced summer runoff. However, the quantitative predictions are difficult to compare, as studies differ in terms of model structure, calibration strategies, input data, temporal and spatial resolution as well as future scenarios used for impact studies. We identify two sources of uncertainties among those emerging from recent research, and use simulations over four glaciers to: i) quantify the importance of the correct extrapolation of air temperature, and ii) point at the key role played by debris cover in modulating glacier response.

Changes in prevailing outdoor weather conditions significantly affect the energy systems of buildings through increased cooling and decreased heating. In this paper, 30 years of data of dry and wet bulb temperatures (1990-2020) with a time interval of 3 h were considered in order to estimate the climatic outdoor design conditions in the cities of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio in the state of Texas. The results suggest that the dry bulb temperature (DBT) had significantly higher increases in Dallas-Fort Worth (2.37 degrees C) than the wet bulb temperature (WBT) in Houston (4.1 degrees C) during the study period. Furthermore, this study analyzed the effects of climate change on cooling degree hours (CDH) and heating degree hours (HDH) and the results suggest the most significant drop in HDH in Dallas-Fort Worth with a maximum CDH fluctuation as compared to other two cities. The effect of climate change on the performance of cooling systems is also investigated in this study via direct evaporative coolers (DECs) and direct-indirect evaporative coolers (IDEC), which do not perform well in the selected cities. In contrast, absorption system (Abs) and vapor compression (VC) systems show an increase in the number of additional loads. The second part of this study is related to the future projection using the ARIMA model, which suggests that DBT would rise significantly in Houston (from 37.18 degrees C to 37.56 degrees C) and Dallas-Fort Worth (39.1 degrees C to 39.57 degrees C) while diminishing in San Antonio (from 34.81 degrees C to 33.95 degrees C) from 2020 to 2030. In contrast, WBT will experience an upward trend in Houston (from 36.06 degrees C to 37.71 degrees C) and Dallas-Fort Worth (from 31.32 degrees C to 31.38 degrees C) and a downward trend in San Antonio (from 32.43 degrees C to 31.97 degrees C) during 2020-2030. Additionally, the future performance prediction of Abs and VC systems is also performed, which reveals that the amount of additional load required is significantly higher in 2030 compared to 2020 and is more prominent in Houston. Conversely, amount of additional load required for cooling systems in San Antonio shows a decreasing trend in 2030.","[Karimi, Alireza; Garcia-Martinez, Antonio; Moreno-Rangel, David] Univ Seville, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construcc, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Seville 41012, Spain; [Kim, You Joung; Brown, Robert D.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Landscape & Architecture, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zadeh, Negar Mohammad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Art, Dept Architecture, Tehran 131451696, Iran; [Delfani, Shahram] Bldg & Housing Res Ctr BHRC, Dept Bldg Installat, Tehran 131451696, Iran; [Mohammad, Pir] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India",University of Sevilla; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Tarbiat Modares University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Karimi, A (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Inst Univ Arquitectura & Ciencias Construcc, Escuela Tecn Super Arquitectura, Seville 41012, Spain.",alikar1@alum.us.es,"; Mohammad, Pir/ABG-3497-2020","Brown, Robert/0000-0001-6955-910X; Mohammad, Pir/0000-0002-0075-6372; Kim, YouJoung/0000-0001-6281-4884",,,,,59,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,22,,,,,,14848,10.3390/su142214848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142214848,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6K6ZW,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000887648400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the current literature provides valuable insight into how school climate perceptions and student motivation impact academic achievement, research examining the mediating effects of motivation in the linking of an innovative educational system, school climate, and achievement is limited. This study considers the potential of the El'konin-Davydov system of developmental education as a basis for educational innovation. Self-determination theory is applied as a useful theoretical framework that allows for consideration of both the intensity and the quality of academic motivation. Objective. The study examines a model that illustrates the role of intrinsic and different types of extrinsic motivation in linking the El'konin-Davydov system of developmental education (DE) and school climate to the academic achievement of elementary schoolchildren. Design. Participants were 345 third and fourth graders drawn from four public schools in Moscow, with some (N = 192, 2 schools) educated in the traditional system and others (N = 153, 2 schools) in one that follows the DE system. A cross-sectional design was implemented. Results. Students in the DE system showed significantly lower external motivation for all three subscales (Parents, Teachers, General) and perceived school climate more favorably. Structural equation modeling showed that the hypothesized model fit the data well, supporting the hypothesis that student external motivation plays a mediating role in linking educational system (innovative vs. traditional) with academic achievement. Students' autonomous motivation was shown to play a mediating role in linking positive perceptions of school climate with academic achievement. Conclusion. The elementary school students from developmental education classes compared to their peers from traditional education classes demonstrate more positive profile of academic motivation including lower external motivation, more positive attitude towards school and study; however, the two groups do not differ in the level of intrinsic, identified, and introjected motivations.","[Gordeeva, Tamara O.; Pshenichnuk, Diana V.; Sidneva, Anastasia N.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Sychev, Oleg A.] Shukshin Altai State Humanities Pedag Univ, Biisk, Russia; [Gordeeva, Tamara O.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Shukshin Altai State University for Humanities & Pedagogy; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Gordeeva, TO (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia.;Gordeeva, TO (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",tamgordeeva@gmail.com,"Sychev, Oleg/B-7944-2016; Sidneva, Anastasia/E-6205-2012","Sychev, Oleg/0000-0002-0373-6916; Sidneva, Anastasia/0000-0002-9815-9049",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [18-013-00386],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The study received the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project No. 18-013-00386.

While the CFSv2 model has been skillful in predicting the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) on seasonal time scales, a century-long simulation with it shows biases in the ocean mixed layer, resulting in a 1.5 degrees C cold bias in the global mean surface air temperature, a cold bias in the sea surface temperature (SST), and a cooler-than-observed troposphere. These biases limit the utility of CFSv2 to study climate change issues. To address biases, and to develop an Indian Earth System Model (IITM ESMv1), the ocean component in CFSv2 was replaced at IITM with an improved version, having better physics and interactive ocean biogeochemistry. A 100-yr simulation with the new coupled model (with biogeochemistry switched off) shows substantial improvements, particularly in global mean surface temperature, tropical SST, and mixed layer depth. The model demonstrates fidelity in capturing the dominant modes of climate variability such as the ENSO and Pacific decadal oscillation. The ENSO-ISM teleconnections and the seasonal leads and lags are also well simulated. The model, a successful result of Indo-U.S. collaboration, will contribute to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) simulations, a first for India.","[Swapna, P.; Roxy, M.

A reason for such a success is the versatility of this technique. Scientists look for conceptual frameworks, and horticulture has offered original case studies on, e.g. photosynthesis or plant architecture. Engineers want procedures to solve practical problems, and horticulture is a field where yield prediction, policy evaluation or process optimisation can be very important. Horticulture is characterised by a high diversity of cultivation systems and fruit, vegetable and ornamental species. Till now, few of them have been modelled and efforts have focused on a limited number of processes of crop growth and development. The water balance of plants, the uptake of minerals, the interaction with pests, diseases and genetics, the interplant variability, and the formation of product quality have been poorly addressed. To face the challenge of diversity, modellers will certainly have to adopt more generic approaches. For decision making, crop models should be integrated in a model of the whole system under control and connected to a model of the decision system. Even though a lot remains to be done, a major achievement of crop modelling in horticulture has been a significant increase of communication tin terms of concepts and modelling tools) in a field where the high diversity of species and cultivation systems can be an obstacle.

Vulnerable ecosystems like the Baltic Sea in North-Eastern Europe tend to be under pressure from multiple, interacting anthropogenic drivers both related to the local scale (e.g. land use change) and the global scale (e.g. climate change). There is currently a lack of scenarios supporting policy-making that systematically explore how global and regional developments could concurrently impact the Baltic Sea region. Here, we present five narratives for future development in the Baltic Sea region, consistent with the global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed for climate research. We focus on agriculture, wastewater treatment, fisheries, shipping, and atmospheric deposition, which all represent major pressures on the Baltic Sea. While we find strong links between the global pathways and regional pressures, we also conclude that each pathway may very well be the host of different sectoral developments, which in turn may have different impacts on the ecosystem state. The extended SSP narratives for the Baltic Sea region are intended as a description of sectoral developments at regional scale that enable detailed scenario analysis and discussions across different sectors and disciplines, but within a common context. In addition, the extended SSPs can readily be combined with climate pathways for integrated scenario analysis of regional environmental problems.","[Zandersen, Marianne] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, IClimate Interdiciplinary Ctr Climate Change, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Hyytiainen, Kari; Haapasaari, Paivi E.; Pihlainen, Sampo; Kosenius, Anna-Kaisa] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Meier, H.

The geographical focus of the paper includes Anatolia and the Levant, two major regions of the Eastern Roman Empire that are rich in environmental, historical and archaeological data. The paper starts with the review of current research on the economic, settlement and vegetation history of the Eastern Mediterranean in Late Antiquity, which provides the necessary framework for the study of potential climate impacts. The core of the article is devoted to the analysis of the palaeoclimatic evidence, which is divided in two groups. The first one encompasses the direct evidence, that is palaeoclimate proxies and the textual record of extreme weather events, while the second includes indirect information on climate, in particular multi-proxy studies that include pollen analysis, archaeological evidence, and the historical evidence of subsistence crises. We conclude that during our study period there occurred three periods of substantially different climatic conditions. A late Roman drought similar to 350-470 AD was followed by a dramatic shift to much wetter climatic conditions. These in turn changed into increasing dryness after similar to 730 AD in Anatolia and similar to 670 AD in the Levant. The lack of chronological precision in the dating of the archaeological evidence and of some climatic records makes it impossible at present to make conclusive observations regarding the societal responses to these climatic fluctuations. Nonetheless in all probability, the extended and - in some areas - severe late Roman drought did not cause any major social upheaval or economic decline in Anatolia or the Levant, although it appears to have contributed to a change in patterns of water use in the cities. In contrast, the increased availability of moisture after -470 AD does appear to have contributed to the expansion of rural settlement and agriculture into environmentally marginal terrain, including semi-arid areas such as the Negev. In this way climate probably contributed to the general economic prosperity of the late Roman Empire in the east of the Mediterranean basin. The end of this late Roman world system came about finally in mid-7th c. and, at least in Anatolia, is not directly associated with any shift in climatic conditions. Aridity during early Medieval times may be one of the main factors behind the gradual long-term decline of settlement on the marginal lands in the Levant following Islamic conquest.

The new 44-year re-analysis produced by the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has been used to construct a new climatology of the Western Indian Ocean. A brief overview of the seasonal cycle of the Western Indian Ocean is presented which emphasizes the importance of the geography of the Indian Ocean basin for controlling the meteorology of the Western Indian Ocean. The principal modes of inter-annual variability are described, associated with El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole or Zonal Mode, and the basic characteristics of the subseasonal weather over the Western Indian Ocean are presented, including new statistics on cyclone tracks derived from the ECMWF re-analyses. Sensitivity experiments, in which the orographic effects of East Africa are removed, have shown that the East African Highlands, although not very high, play a significant role in the climate of Africa, India and Southeast Asia, and in the heat, salinity and momentum forcing of the Western Indian Ocean. The hydrological cycle over Africa. is systematically enhanced in all seasons by the presence of the East African Highlands, and during the Asian summer monsoon there is a major redistribution of the rainfall across India and Southeast Asia. The implied impact of the East African Highlands on the ocean is substantial. The East African Highlands systematically freshen the tropical Indian Ocean, and act to focus the monsoon winds along the coast, leading to greater upwelling and cooler sea-surface temperatures.","Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Ctr Global Atmospher Modelling, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading,"Slingo, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, NCAS Ctr Global Atmospher Modelling, Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",j.m.slingo@reading.ac.uk,"Black, Emily/N-4633-2019; Black, Emily/V-4122-2017; Weller, Hilary/A-1565-2011","Black, Emily/0000-0003-1344-6186; Black, Emily/0000-0003-1344-6186; Weller, Hilary/0000-0003-4553-7082",,,,,37,71,72,1,24,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide are expected to affect the hydrological cycle through increases in global mean temperature and the water vapour content of the atmosphere(2-4). However, regional precipitation changes also closely depend on the atmospheric circulation, which is expected to weaken in a warmer world(4-6). Here, we assess the effect of a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on tropical circulation and precipitation by analysing results from a suite of simulations from multiple state-of-the-art climate models, and an operational numerical weather prediction model. In a scenario in which humans continue to use fossil fuels unabated, about half the tropical circulation change projected by the end of the twenty-first century, and consequently a large fraction of the regional precipitation change, is independent of global surfacewarming. Instead, these robust circulation and precipitation changes are a consequence of the weaker net radiative cooling of the atmosphere associated with higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which affects the strength of atmospheric vertical motions. This implies that geo-engineering schemes aimed at reducing global warming without removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would fail to fully mitigate precipitation changes in the tropics. Strategies that may help constrain rainfall projections are suggested.","[Bony, Sandrine; Fermepin, Solange; Denvil, Sebastien] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LMD IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France; [Bellon, Gilles] CNRS, CNRM GAME, Meteo France, F-31057 Toulouse, France; [Klocke, Daniel] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Sherwood, Steven] Univ New S Wales, CCRC, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Sherwood, Steven] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Excellence Climate Syst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Bony, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, LMD IPSL, F-75252 Paris, France.",bony@lmd.jussieu.fr,"Sherwood, Steven/B-5673-2008; Veenith, Tonny/A-9948-2010; Bony, Sandrine/AAG-5804-2019","Sherwood, Steven/0000-0001-7420-8216; Veenith, Tonny/0000-0002-4125-8804; Bony, Sandrine/0000-0002-4791-4438; Denvil, Sebastien/0000-0002-6715-3533; Klocke, Daniel/0000-0001-7405-013X; Bellon, Gilles/0000-0003-3981-1225",European Union [244067]; French CEP&S ANR project ClimaConf; LEFE project Missterre,European Union(European Commission); French CEP&S ANR project ClimaConf(French National Research Agency (ANR)); LEFE project Missterre,"This work benefited from discussions with K.

Focusing on September hindcasts over 2000-2015 initialized monthly from April-August, calibration improves forecast skill for all models tested, but greatest skill is achieved by the calibrated MM ensemble. Compared against a climatology adjusted for trends, skill is seen over most of the Arctic for all MM formulations and at all lead times, with highest skill obtained by the calibrated MM ensemble.

We separately consider the HinduKush Karakoram (HKK) in the west and the Himalaya in the east. These two regions are characterized by different precipitation climatologies, which are associated with different circulation patterns. Historical model simulations are compared with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation data in the period 1901-2005. Future precipitation is analyzed for the two representative concentration pathways (RCP) RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. We find that the multi-model ensemble mean and most individual models exhibit a wet bias with respect to CRU and GPCC observations in both regions and for all seasons. The models differ greatly in the seasonal climatology of precipitation which they reproduce in the HKK. The CMIP5 models predict wetter future conditions in the Himalaya in summer, with a gradual precipitation increase throughout the 21st century. Wetter summer future conditions are also predicted by most models in the RCP 8.5 scenario for the HKK, while on average no significant change can be detected in winter precipitation for both regions. In general, no single model (or group of models) emerges as that providing the best results for all the statistics considered, and the large spread in the behavior of individual models suggests to consider multi-model ensemble means with extreme care.","[Palazzi, Elisa; von Hardenberg, Jost; Terzago, Silvia; Provenzale, Antonello] CNR, ISAC, I-10133 Turin, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e del Clima (ISAC-CNR),"Palazzi, E (corresponding author), CNR, ISAC, Corso Fiume 4, I-10133 Turin, Italy.",e.palazzi@isac.cnr.it,"palazzi, elisa/C-7048-2015; Terzago, Silvia/F-3801-2018; von Hardenberg, Jost/D-1872-2010","palazzi, elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; Terzago, Silvia/0000-0001-7867-0440; von Hardenberg, Jost/0000-0002-5312-8070","Project of Interest NextData - Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research","Project of Interest NextData - Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research","This work was supported by the Project of Interest NextData (www.nextdataproject.it), funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research.

The large-scale Delta GWS can be simulated from a land surface model (LSM), but the high model uncertainty is a major drawback that reduces the reliability of the estimates. The evaluation of the model estimate is then very important to assess its accuracy. To improve the model performance, the terrestrial water storage variation derived from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission is commonly assimilated into LSMs to enhance the accuracy of the Delta GWS estimate. This study assimilates GRACE data into the PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) model. The GRACE data assimilation (DA) is developed based on the three-dimensional ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS 3D), which considers the statistical correlation of all extents (spatial, temporal, vertical) in the DA process. The Delta GWS estimates from GRACE DA and four LSM simulations (PCR-GLOBWB, the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE), the Water Global Assessment and Prognosis Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), and World-Wide Water (W3)) are validated against the in situ groundwater data. The evaluation is conducted in terms of temporal correlation, seasonality, long-term trend, and detection of groundwater depletion. The GRACE DA estimate shows a significant improvement in all measures, notably the correlation coefficients (respect to the in situ data) are always higher than the values obtained from model simulations alone (e.g., similar to 0.15 greater in Australia, and similar to 0.1 greater in the NCP). GRACE DA also improves the estimation of groundwater depletion that the models cannot accurately capture due to the incorrect information of the groundwater demand (in, e.g., PCR-GLOBWB, WGHM) or the unavailability of a groundwater consumption routine (in, e.g., CABLE, W3). In addition, this study conducts the inter-comparison between four model simulations and reveals that PCR-GLOBWB and CABLE provide a more accurate Delta GWS estimate in Australia (subject to the calibrated parameter) while PCR-GLOBWB and WGHM are more accurate in the NCP (subject to the inclusion of anthropogenic factors). The analysis can be used to declare the status of the Delta GWS estimate, as well as itemize the possible improvements of the future model development.","[Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet; Han, Shin-Chan] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Tian, Siyuan] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Tian, Siyuan] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Schmied, Hannes Mueller] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Phys Geog, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmied, Hannes Mueller] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Sutanudjaja, Edwin H.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Phys Geog, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ran, Jiangjun; Feng, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China","University of Newcastle; Australian National University; Australian National University; Goethe University Frankfurt; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Utrecht University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geodesy & Geophysics, CAS","Tangdamrongsub, N (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",natthachet.tangdamrongsub@newcastle.edu.au; shin-chan.han@newcastle.edu.au; siyuan.tian@anu.edu.au; hannes.mueller.schmied@em.uni-frankfurt.de; e.h.sutanudjaja@uu.nl; jiangjunran@gmail.com; fengwei@whigg.ac.cn,"Ran, Jiangjun/U-2143-2018; Tian, Siyuan/GNH-3708-2022; Schmied, Hannes Müller/K-6231-2013; Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet/X-6350-2019","Ran, Jiangjun/0000-0001-9245-3346; Tian, Siyuan/0000-0002-7688-0249; Schmied, Hannes Müller/0000-0001-5330-9923; Tangdamrongsub, Natthachet/0000-0002-9578-2257; Feng, Wei/0000-0001-8873-0750; Han, Shin-Chan/0000-0003-1810-1670",University of Newcastle,University of Newcastle,"This work is funded by The University of Newcastle to support NASA's GRACE and GRACE Follow-On projects as an international science team member to the missions.

Most large and prosperous cities in China are located along coastal regions and are thus likely to suffer huge economic impacts when a sea level rise occurs. The effects on coastal regions can also be transmitted to inland regions through movement of labor and trade, thus affecting regional disparity. To strengthen evidence-based policies of abatement and adaptation, it is essential to assess the economic impacts of sea level rise in addition to the physical impacts already investigated in the literature. Based on data from GIS analysis of flooded areas, this study uses a state-of-the-art technique (TERM-China, a multiregional general equilibrium model of China) to evaluate the economic impacts of sea level rise. The simulation results suggest that if the sea level rise coincides with sudden-onset extreme storm surges, the coastal regions' GDP loss would reach 11% in 2050, wherein Tianjin, Shanghai, and Jiangsu would have the most severe losses with over a 20% decline in their individual GDP in 2050. At the sectoral level, high capital-intensive sectors have more significant output losses. Our results also indicate that sea level rise could cause more unemployment in developed coastal regions, drive people to other developing inland regions, and even convert some mega-cities into middle-scale cities.

Several studies have been conducted on NZEBs. However, a thorough exploration of the literature is lacking. This study aims to systematically and comprehensively explore the state-of-the-art in NZEBs research, and to provide recommendations about research gaps and future research directions. Adopting mixed-methods, first, a quantitative bibliometric analysis was conducted on 2724 articles retrieved from Scopus. Results indicated that the year 2006 marked the beginning of the current steady and gradual increase in NZEBs research. Main research themes include energy efficiency, zero energy building, life cycle assessment, embodied energy, building simulation, and residential buildings. Influential jurisdictions and outlets were identified. Second, a further qualitative systematic analysis was performed of 528 carefully selected articles, to identify gaps in the existing knowledge. Based on identified gaps, this study suggested future research directions, including (1) strategies for existing buildings retrofit, (2) promotion of NZEBs at the neighborhood scale, (3) innovative business models for delivering NZEBs, and (4) stakeholder partnership and synergies in promoting NZEBs. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the state-of-the-art development and future needs of NZEBs research, equipping researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to hone and promote the research towards achieving the global net-zero target by 2050.

Nevertheless, SDM projections are affected by a wide range of uncertainty factors (related to training data, climate projections and SDM techniques), which limit their potential value and credibility. The new package mopa provides tools for designing comprehensive multi-factor SDM ensemble experiments, combining multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. baseline climate, pseudo-absence realizations, SDM techniques, future projections) and allowing to assess their contribution to the overall spread of the ensemble projection. In addition, mopa is seamlessly integrated with the climate4R bundle and allows straightforward retrieval and post-processing of state-of-the-art climate datasets (including observations and climate change projections), thus facilitating the proper analysis of key uncertainty factors related to climate data.","[Iturbide, M.; Gutierrez, J.

As the earth is now in a period of rising global temperatures a number of authors have considered the stochastic properties of time series of both atmospheric and oceanic temperatures from instrumental and proxy records on time scales of a few decades to several millenia in an effort to estimate the natural variability of the earth's climate. These series almost universally exhibit the property of statistical long memory. Long memory time series were brought to prominence by H. E. Hurst in 1951 in his study of river flows. Since then the physical cause or causes of the so-called Hurst phenomena have remained elusive. Two sets of competing models have been proposed. The fractional Gaussian noises (FGNs) and their discrete time counter-parts, the fractionally integrated processes of order d (FI(d)), possess genuine long memory in the sense that the present state of a system is temporally dependent on all past states. The alternative are models with a non-stationary mean. In these models the long memory is merely an artifact of the method of analysis. Some authors have proposed multifractals as a potential model. These are FGNs or FI(d) series in which the self-similarity parameter, H, or fractional integration order, d, is allowed to change with time. A number of authors have attempted to develop statistical tests to distinguish between true long memory and other types of processes displaying statistical long memory. Most of these tests exploit, in some fashion, the fact that the self-similarity parameter, H, in the FGNs is required to be constant across the whole series. It is known that structural break location methods tend to report breaks in simulated long memory series where no breaks exist. We have combined established methods for estimating H and/or d with a computationally fast structural break location method, Atheoretical Regression Trees (ART), to obtain empirical bivariate distributions of H or d and regime length for simulated FGNs. These bivariate distributions are then compared with a 2649 year warm season temperature reconstruction using data from a stalagtite from Shihua Cave near Beijing, China and with an existing test for fit to an FGN due to Beran. We find the time series is not H-self-similar. We further compared several other empirically determined bivariate distributions from the simulated data with the Shihua Cave data. In all but one case (mean vs regime length) the Shihua Cave data did not fit the empirical distributions for FGNs. We can discount the FGNs and FI(d)s as appropriate models for the Shihua Cave data. However, we could not establish statistical primacy between multifractals and multiple regimes of short memory processes. The implications for the climate change debate are minimal. There seems little doubt the current rising global temperatures are occurring because of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations as a result of human activity. Discounting of the H-self-similar and the FI(d) models for this data leaves the doubters with one less argument to support their case.","[Rea, William; Reale, Marco; Brown, Jennifer] Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Rea, W (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",marco.reale@canterbury.ac.nz,"Brown, Jennifer/E-7878-2013","Brown, Jennifer/0000-0001-6150-7284",,,,,21,2,2,0,1,MODELLING & SIMULATION SOC AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND INC,CHRISTCHURCH,"MSSANZ, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND",,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,3010,3016,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BUQ25,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000290030703010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the large number of industrial parks around the world, they are an important and arguably, an appropriate level at which to manage GHG. The question being considered in this paper is whether a multi-disciplinary, muti-dimensional and integrated approach could result in a practical and cost-effective management plan for a carbon neutral eco-industrial park. Taking Debert Air Industrial Park (DAIP), Nova Scotia as an example, a combination of tenant and park strategies, which companies can adopt both individually and collectively in concert with industrial park planners and management are identified and are already being implemented in parks to reduce GHG emissions. The study also involved a survey of business managers. While we agree that some individual strategies such as enhancing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency initiatives will have significant impact, we conclude that a wider mix of strategies including land use planning will be necessary to result in a low carbon, resilient and ecologically sustainable park. Implementing these strategies will be helpful to reduce or offset GHG emissions at an industrial park level and facilitate the transition of industrial parks towards an eco-industrial development in both regenerative and preventative ways through planning, design and management.

Their tighter integration decreases not only the emissions, but also the energy consumption of buildings and transportation. Energy integration and interactions between buildings and vehicles are dependent on the type of building, vehicle, and renewable energy system, as well as the local climatic conditions. The current academic literature does not provide a systematic analysis of this topic. In the study, different energy management systems and advanced energy control strategies have been formulated to study such interactions both from a building and a vehicle perspective. Furthermore, technical solutions have been systematically reviewed in terms of the enhancement of energy interaction capabilities, in particular from the standpoint of renewable energy systems, energy/fuel charging facilities, and control strategies. Assessment criteria employed in the review of solutions include grid interaction, annual operational cost, annual net CO2 emissions, and annual matching capability. The literature review identifies several technical challenges that need further consideration such as capacity expansion and power fluctuation of the electric grid, low efficiency of heat recovered from electricity generation, and depreciation of vehicles. The future outlook and potential for the energy interaction networks between buildings and vehicles have also been presented.","[Zhou, Yuekuan; Cao, Sunliang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, RERG, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Fac Construct & Environm,Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hensen, Jan L.

This situation mirrors that of many developing countries. This study aims to investigate the factors that drive the implementation of the footprint programme and obstacles that may hinder its long-term implementation. Benefits gained from this programme are also explored. A questionnaire was sent to companies that were or have been certified for the Thai carbon footprint label. Interviews with experts were also conducted to supplement the survey data. According to the statistical analysis, companies expected the carbon footprint programme to enhance their green image, increase their sales and reduce costs. However, benefits derived only in terms of the company's image, employee development and satisfaction, and production costs returned, while no sales and marketing benefits were evident. The lack of social awareness of the label and of the climate change issue was the most significant challenge the implementers faced, as its rating scores were significantly higher than those of other barriers. Small companies also encountered difficulties due to the required initial investment. This study provides insight into the reasons many developing countries fail to pursue carbon labelling programmes. These issues have not yet been clarified by previous studies. The findings can help prospective companies overcome potential barriers and facilitate their strategic decision making. They can also help governments to develop appropriate policies to promote the carbon footprint label and enhance national sustainability.","[Sureeyatanapas, Panitas; Yodprang, Kanittha] Khon Kean Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Supply Chain & Logist Syst Res Unit, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand; [Varabuntoonvit, Viganda] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",Khon Kaen University; Kasetsart University,"Sureeyatanapas, P (corresponding author), Khon Kean Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Supply Chain & Logist Syst Res Unit, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.",panisu@kku.ac.th; fernfluffy@hotmail.com; fengvgv@ku.th,"Varabuntoonvit, Viganda/AAE-4753-2022; Varabuntoonvit, Viganda/ABA-5708-2021","Varabuntoonvit, Viganda/0000-0003-0641-3052; Sureeyatanapas, Panitas/0000-0003-1059-3586","Research Administration Division and Supply Chain and Logistics System Research Unit, Khon Kean University","Research Administration Division and Supply Chain and Logistics System Research Unit, Khon Kean University","This research was funded by the Research Administration Division and Supply Chain and Logistics System Research Unit, Khon Kean University.",,70,2,2,2,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,12,,,,,,6543,10.3390/su13126543,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126543,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SZ2CP,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000666380300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and Reco within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted. Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme-event impacts on GPP, Reco, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30-year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO2 flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones. Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they downregulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and Reco and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other. Taken together, compound heat and drought events led to the strongest C sink reduction compared to any single-factor extreme. A key insight of this paper, however, is that duration matters most: for heat stress during droughts, the magnitude of impacts systematically increased with duration, whereas under heat stress without drought, the response of Reco over time turned from an initial increase to a downregulation after about 2 weeks. This confirms earlier theories that not only the magnitude but also the duration of an extreme event determines its impact. Our study corroborates the results of several local site-level case studies but as a novelty generalizes these findings on the global scale. Specifically, we find that the different response functions of the two antipodal land-atmosphere fluxes GPP and Reco can also result in increasing NEP during certain extreme conditions. Apparently counterintuitive findings of this kind bear great potential for scrutinizing the mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models and provide a benchmark for future model development and testing.","[von Buttlar, Jannis; Zscheischler, Jakob; Sippel, Sebastian; Reichstein, Markus; Jung, Martin; Migliavacca, Mirco; Mahecha, Miguel D.] Max Planck Inst Biochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [von Buttlar, Jannis; Knohl, Alexander] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Wilhelmspl 1, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Zscheischler, Jakob; Buchmann, Nina; Merbold, Lutz] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rammig, Anja] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Sippel, Sebastian] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Hogskoleveien 8, N-1431 As, Norway; [Reichstein, Markus; Mahecha, Miguel D.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Menzer, Olaf] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Arain, M.

However, they are little used, at least in any formal way, in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is puzzling because EIA is a process specifically dedicated to exploring options for more-sustainable (i.e., less environmentally damaging) futures. In this paper, we review the state of the art associated with scenarios and scenario analysis, and describe two areas where scenario analysis could be particularly helpful in EIA: (a) in defining future developments for cumulative effects assessment; and (b) in considering the influence of contextual change - e.g. climate change - on impact forecasts for specific projects. We conclude by encouraging EIA practitioners to learn about the promise of scenario-based analysis and implement scenario-based methods so that EIA can become more effective in fostering sustainable development.

To understand the underlying reasons for this climate sensitivity, reanalysis is an invaluable tool. The Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) is a regional reanalysis, forced by ERA-Interim at the lateral boundaries and incorporating model physics adapted to Arctic conditions, developed to serve as a state-of-the-art, high-resolution synthesis tool for assessing Arctic climate variability and monitoring Arctic climate change. We use data from Arctic Summer Cloud-Ocean Study (ASCOS) to evaluate the performance of ASR and ERAInterim for the Arctic Ocean. The ASCOS field experiment was deployed on the Swedish icebreaker Oden north of 87 degrees N in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic during August and early September 2008. Data were collected during the transits from and to Longyearbyen and the 3-week ice drift with Oden moored to a drifting multiyear ice floe. These data are independent and detailed enough to evaluate process descriptions. The reanalyses captures basic meteorological variations coupled to the synoptic-scale systems, but have difficulties in estimating clouds and atmospheric moisture. While ERAInterim has a systematic warm bias in the lowest troposphere, ASR has a cold bias of about the same magnitude on average. The results also indicate that more sophisticated descriptions of cloud microphysics in ASR did not significantly improve the modeling of cloud properties compared to ERA-Interim. This has consequences for the radiation balance, and hence the surface temperature, and illustrate how a modeling problem in one aspect of the atmosphere, here the clouds, feeds back to other parameters, especially near the surface and in the boundary layer.","[Wesslen, C.; Tjernstrom, M.; Ekman, A.

Earth system model projections indicate that a reduction in the oxygen inventory of the global ocean, termed ocean deoxygenation, is a likely consequence of on-going anthropogenic warming. Current models are, however, unable to consistently reproduce the observed trends and variability of recent decades, particularly within the established tropical OMZs. Here, we conduct a series of targeted hindcast model simulations using a state-of-the-art global ocean biogeochemistry model in order to explore and review biases in model distributions of oceanic oxygen. We show that the largest magnitude of uncertainty is entrained into ocean oxygen response patterns due to model parametrization of pCO(2)-sensitive C: N ratios in carbon fixation and imposed atmospheric forcing data. Inclusion of a pCO(2)-sensitive C: N ratio drives historical oxygen depletion within the ocean interior due to increased organic carbon export and subsequent remineralization. Atmospheric forcing is shown to influence simulated interannual variability in ocean oxygen, particularly due to differences in imposed variability of wind stress and heat fluxes.

The objective of this study is to determine the performance of an efficient solar cooling system for Athens, the most populated city in Greece. The examined solar cooling system is a one stage water/lithium-bromide absorption chiller driven by a parabolic trough collector coupled with a storage tank. A numerical model is developed in order to simulate the dynamic performance of this system. Many parameters have been investigated through sensitivity analyses and their optimum values are determined. The mass flow rates and the storage tank volume are the parameters that have been examined parametrically. The final results proved that by using a PTC module with an aperture area of 14 m(2), a building area of about 25 m(2) can be cooled for 13 h daily during the summer period. The optimum specific mass flow rate was determined to 0.03 kg/sm(2) and the optimum storage tank volume to 0.3 m(3). Moreover, a case study for a typical building of 100 m(2) is presented with very satisfying results, where four PTC modules are used in parallel connection.","[Tzivanidis, Christos; Bellos, Evangelos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Thermal Dept, Heroon Polytecheiou 9, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Bellos, E (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Thermal Dept, Heroon Polytecheiou 9, Athens, Greece.",bellose@central.ntua.gr,"Bellos, Evangelos/N-5155-2016","Bellos, Evangelos/0000-0002-5876-6549; Tzivanidis, Christos/0000-0002-5661-3047",Onassis foundation,Onassis foundation,Evangelos Bellos would like to thank Onassis foundation for its financial support.,,30,49,49,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-157X,,,CASE STUD THERM ENG,Case Stud.

Nevertheless, there are few attempts to quantitatively describe cambium dynamics. In this study, we develop a state-of-the-art band model of cambium development, based on the kinetic heterogeneity of the cambial zone and the connectivity of the cell structure. The model describes seasonal cambium development based on an exponential function under climate forcing which can be effectively used to estimate the seasonal cell production for individual trees. It was shown that the model is able to simulate different cell production for fast-, middle- and slow-growing trees under the same climate forcing. Based on actual measurements of cell production for two contrasted trees, the model effectively reconstructed long-term cell production variability (up to 75% of explained variance) of both tree-ring characteristics over the period 1937-2012. The new model significantly simplifies the assessment of seasonal cell production for individual trees of a studied forest stand and allows the entire range of individual absolute variability in the ring formation of any tree in the stand to be quantified, which can lead to a better understanding of the anatomy of xylem formation, a key component of the carbon cycle.</p>","[Shishov, Vladimir V.; Tychkov, Ivan I.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Fundamental Biol & Biothechnol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Shishov, Vladimir V.; Vaganov, Eugene A.] Russian Acad Sci, Sukachev Inst Forest, Siberian Branch, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia; [Tychkov, Ivan I.; Zelenov, Grigory K.; Vaganov, Eugene A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Ecol & Geog, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Anchukaitis, Kevin J.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Siberian Federal University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Krasnoyarsk Science Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences; Siberian Federal University; University of Arizona; University of Arizona","Shishov, VV (corresponding author), Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Fundamental Biol & Biothechnol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia.;Shishov, VV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Sukachev Inst Forest, Siberian Branch, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia.;Anchukaitis, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Lab Tree Ring Res, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Anchukaitis, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog Dev & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",vlad.shishov@gmail.com; ivan.tychkov@gmail.com; kanchukaitis@arizona.edu; zelenov.grigory@yandex.ru; eavaganov@hotmail.com,"Shishov, Vladimir/I-6256-2013","Shishov, Vladimir/0000-0001-8850-6142; Tychkov, Ivan/0000-0001-5445-1323",RFBR project [19-04-00274A]; Minobrnauki project [FSRZ-2020-0010]; Russian Science Foundation [18-14-00072P]; ERC project MONOSTAR [AdG 882727],RFBR project(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Minobrnauki project; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); ERC project MONOSTAR,"The work was supported by the RFBR project#19-04-00274A and Minobrnauki project #FSRZ-2020-0010 (methodology, model development; data measurements).

Analyzing this choice typically requires a model. State-of-the-art coastal risk models provide detailed regional information, but they can be difficult to implement, computationally challenging, and potentially inaccessible. Simple economic damage models are more accessible but may not incorporate important features and thus fail to model risks and trade offs with enough fidelity to support decision making. Here, we develop a new framework to analyze coastal flood risk management. The framework is computationally inexpensive yet incorporates common features of many coastal cities. We apply this framework to an idealized coastal city and assess and optimize two objectives using combinations of risk mitigation strategies against a wide range of future states of the world. We find that optimization using combinations of strategies allows for identification of Pareto optimal strategy combinations that outperform individual strategy options.","[Ceres, Robert L.; Forest, Chris E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Meteorol & Atmospher Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Forest, Chris E.; Keller, Klaus] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16803 USA; [Forest, Chris E.; Keller, Klaus] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Sci Inst, University Pk, PA 16803 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Forest, CE (corresponding author), 507 Walker Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA.",rlc299@psu.edu; ceforest@psu.edu; kzk10@psu.edu,"Keller, Klaus/A-6742-2013; Forest, Chris E/M-1993-2014","Forest, Chris E/0000-0002-2643-0186",National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF [GEO-1240507]; Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management,National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF; Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management,"We thank D.

Sea ice inhibits heat and moisture transport from the ocean to the atmosphere, and, as a result, the boundary layer is cold, stable, and clear over sea ice and warm, moist, well mixed, and cloudy over open water. The mean low-cloud fraction observed by CALIPSO is roughly 0.7 over open water and 0.4-0.5 over sea ice, and the low-cloud layer is deeper over open water. Low-level winds in excess of 10ms 21 are common over sea ice. Cold advection off of the sea ice pack causes enhanced low-cloud fraction over open water, and thus an enhanced longwave cloud radiative effect at the surface. Quantitative estimates of the surface longwave cloud radiative effect contributed by low clouds are presented. Finally, 10 state-of-the-art global climate models with satellite simulators are compared to observations. Near the sea ice edge, 7 out of 10 models simulate cloudier conditions over open water than over sea ice. Most models also underestimate low-cloud fraction both over sea ice and over open water.","[Wall, Casey J.; Kohyama, Tsubasa; Hartmann, Dennis L.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Wall, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",caseyw8@atmos.washington.edu,"Kohyama, Tsubasa/Q-6214-2017","Kohyama, Tsubasa/0000-0002-5606-2062; Wall, Casey/0000-0001-7682-5576","NASA [NNX14AJ26G]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS-1549579, AGS-0960497]; Takenaka Scholarship Foundation",NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Takenaka Scholarship Foundation,"This research was conducted with support from NASA Grant NNX14AJ26G, Terra and Aqua Science.

In addition, the role of architecture in contributing to community resilience against climate change has been overlooked. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to shed light on what is the current state of the art of community resilience in rural towns and what type of architectural strategies has been recognised for facilitating resilience. Design/methodology/approach - The study has combined literature review and architectural project review. Findings - There are four major findings to this research that could impact policy making and decision making if implemented at different institutional levels. First, there is an evident increased academic interest on this topic. Second, there is a need for a greater consultation among the different stakeholders that participate in the planning and implementation of the future-focused adaptation strategies. Third, the potential for the architectural discipline to play an active role in facilitating and ameliorating community resilience has been identified. Fourth, there is a need to integrate placed-based and identity-related factors/components into a community's framework for resilience amelioration. Research limitations/implications - One limitation is the fact that the literature review investigated only English literature. Also, the review relied mostly on online findings and, for the good-practice review, did not take into consideration direct local knowledge, which would have required travelling the globe and all of Australia in order to collect feedback. Thus, some projects and literature might have been missed. Originality/value - The value of this research is to compare findings from literature review (scholar activities) and best practices (architectural activities). In combining the two aspects, it merges a gap in research.","[Dupre, Karine; Bischeri, Cecilia] Griffith Univ, Dept Architecture, Gold Coast, Australia",Griffith University,"Dupre, K (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Dept Architecture, Gold Coast, Australia.",k.dupre@griffith.edu.au,"DUPRE, Karine/G-9046-2019","DUPRE, Karine/0000-0002-1936-0597","School of Environment, Griffith University, Australia","School of Environment, Griffith University, Australia","This research was funded by School of Environment, Griffith University, Australia, as part of the Seed Project.",,66,2,3,1,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2631-6862,1938-7806,,ARCHNET-IJAR,Archnet-IJAR,,2020,2,,,,187,202,,10.1108/ARCH-07-2019-0178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ARCH-07-2019-0178,,,16,Architecture,Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Architecture,OQ2KJ,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000588618100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The last trend has largely been facilitated by the proliferation of the global Girl Effect' campaign, or the unique potential of 600 million adolescent girls to end poverty for themselves and the world' (Girl Effect 2011). This article reports on findings from a global ethnography - involving semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document analysis - that considered how sport-oriented Girl Effect interventions impact the lives of girls they target. Using a Girl Effect-focused partnership among a TNC (based in Western Europe), an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) (based in Western Europe) and a Southern NGO (based in Uganda) as a case study, this article examines how SGD programs for Ugandan girls encourage them to become entrepreneurs of themselves' (Rose 1999) equipped to survive in the current global neoliberal climate using social entrepreneurial tactics such as training to be martial arts instructors combined with activities such as cultivating nuts. Results show how Girl Effect-oriented SGD programs that focus on social entrepreneurship tend to overlook the broader structural inequalities and gender relations that marginalize girls in the first place. I conclude by suggesting that future studies must further explore the socio-economic, cultural and political implications and consequences that social entrepreneurship and economic forms' of SGD interventions hold for girls. El Efecto Nina y las artes marciales: el emprendimiento social y el deporte, el genero y el desarrollo en UgandaEn los ultimos anos, tres tendencias notables emergieron en el paisaje del genero y el desarrollo: el creciente uso del deporte como herramienta para lograr objetivos de genero y desarrollo (SGD, por sus siglas en ingles); la participacion en creciente de las corporaciones transnacionales (CTN) en la creacion, la financiacion y la implementacion de los programas de desarrollo; y el aninamiento (girling) del desarrollo. La ultima tendencia ha sido principalmente facilitada por la proliferacion de la campana global Efecto Nina o el potencial unico de 600 millones de adolescentes mujeres para terminar con la pobreza por ellas mismas y para el mundo (Girl Effect 2011, sin paginar). Este articulo informa sobre los resultados de una etnografia global - que involucra entrevistas semiestructuradas, observacion participante y analisis de documentos - que considero como las intervenciones del Efecto Nina orientadas al deporte impactan sobre las vidas de las ninas a las que estan dirigidas. Utilizando una sociedad centrada en el Efecto Nina entre una CTN (basada en Europa occidental), una organizacion no gubernamental (ONG) (basada en Europa occidental) y una ONG del sur (basada en Uganda) como estudio de caso, este articulo analiza como los programas SGD para las ninas ugandesas estimulan a las mismas a convertirse en emprendedoras de si mismas (Rose 1999), equipadas para sobrevivir en el actual clima neoliberal global utilizando tacticas de emprendimiento social tales como la capacitacion para ser instructoras de artes marciales combinado con actividades como el cultivo de frutas secas. Los resultados muestran como los programas SGD con orientacion Efecto Nina que se centran en el emprendimiento social tienden a pasar por alto las desigualdades estructurales y las relaciones de genero mas amplias que marginalizan a las ninas en primer termino. Concluyo sugiriendo que los futuros estudios deben explorar mas las implicancias y consecuencias socioeconomicas, culturales y politicas que el emprendimiento social y las formas economicas de las intervenciones SGD tienen para las ninas. ???????????????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????(SGD);????(TNCs)????????????????????;?? ??? ????????????????? ???? ???????,?? ???????????????????? ?????(???? 2011 ,?????)??????????????????????????????????????? ???? ???,???????????????????????(???)??????????(???)????????????(????)???? ???? ???????????,???????????

Diesel vehicle particulate emissions which are virtually all smaller than 2.5 microns raise additional special concerns due to their carcinogenicity and high ratio of black carbon (BC) to organic carbon; black carbon has recently been found to be the second most important contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide. Other pollutants emitted by diesels and other vehicles such as the oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds also contribute to ambient particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5) after undergoing secondary transformations in the atmosphere. Technologies have been developed that can dramatically reduce vehicle emissions when clean, low sulfur fuels are available and these technologies are being phased in throughout the industrialized world resulting in a global decrease in particulate matter (PM) and BC emissions from vehicles. However the vehicle population is growing rapidly in the developing world, leading to increases in emissions in many countries.

In this paper, pest reporting for the continents of Africa and Europe are discussed, and argued as a barometer of effective Plant Pest Diagnostic Services (PPDS) in terms of human capacity, infrastructure and policy-culture for phytosanitary issues. To illustrate particular areas of concern, case studies are presented on recent pest events which include outbreaks of Ralstonia solanacearum on Pelargonium, Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum on banana (banana Xanthomonas wilt) and Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici race Ug99 on wheat (black stem rust). Examples are given of some recent initiatives to invigorate diagnostic capacity in East Africa, spanning state-of-the-art centres of excellence, traditional capacity building and networking projects, and grass-root level 'going-public' pest surveillance initiatives. Discussion is presented on the provision of PPDS and the impact of technology, institutional factors, the private sector, accreditation of services and policy. Emphasis is placed on the role of PPDS in support of regulatory policy. In recognising the precarious nature of many African cropping systems, the argument is made for a more consolidated approach to PPDS in and for Africa.

To be as critical as possible, we validate the raw model and the calibrated forecasts in terms of a number of metrics which take into account different aspects of forecast quality (association, accuracy, discrimination and reliability). We focus on one-month lead forecasts of precipitation and temperature from four state-of-the-art seasonal forecasting systems, three of them included in the Copernicus Climate Change Service dataset (ECMWF-SEAS5, UK Met Office-GloSea5 and Meteo France-System5) for boreal winter and summer over two illustrative regions with different skill characteristics (Europe and Southeast Asia). Our results indicate that both BA and RC methods effectively correct the large raw model biases, which is of paramount importance for users, particularly when directly using the climate model outputs to run impact models, or when computing climate indices depending on absolute values/thresholds. However, except for particular regions and/or seasons (typically with high skill), there is only marginal added value-with respect to the raw model outputs-beyond this bias removal. For those cases, RC methods can outperform BA ones, mostly due to an improvement in reliability. Finally, we also show that whereas an increase in the number of members only modestly affects the results obtained from calibration, longer hindcast periods lead to improved forecast quality, particularly for RC methods.","[Manzanas, R.; Gutierrez, J.

Objective prediction of the summer rainfall anomaly pattern turns out to be very challenging. As shown in the present study, the contemporary state-of-the-art dynamical models' 1-month-lead prediction of China summer rainfall (CSR) anomalies has insignificant skills. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore other ways to improve CSR prediction. The present study proposes a combined empirical orthogonal function (EOF)-partial least squares (PLS) regression method to offer a potential long-lead objective prediction of spatial distribution of CSR anomalies. The essence of the methodology is to use PLS regression to predict the principal component (PC) of the first five leading EOF modes of CSR. The preceding December-January mean surface temperature field [ST; i.e., SST over ocean and 2-m air temperature (T2m) over land] is selected as the predictor field for all five PCs because SST and snow cover, which is reflected by 2-m air temperature, are the most important factors that affect CSR and because the correlation between each mode and ST during winter is higher than in spring. The 4-month-lead forecast models are established by using the data from 1979 to 2004. A 9-yr independent forward-rolling prediction is made for the latest 9 yr (2005-13) as a strict forecast validation. The pattern correlation coefficient skill (0.32) between the observed and the 4-month-lead predicted patterns during the independent forecast period of 2005-13 is significantly higher than the dynamic models' 1-month-lead hindcast skill (0.04), which indicates that the EOF-PLS regression is a useful tool for improving the current seasonal rainfall prediction. Issues related to the EOF-PLS method are also discussed.","[Xing, Wen] Ocean Univ China, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Phys Oceanog Lab, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Bin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Earth Syst Modeling Ctr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yim, So-Young] Korea Meteorol Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Ocean University of China; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA),"Xing, W (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Marine Meteorol, Qingdao Collaborat Innovat Ctr Marine Sci & Techn, Phys Oceanog Lab, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",xingwen1022@gmail.com,,,"Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center - Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; National Research Foundation of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory (GRL) grant of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) [2011-0021927]; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers [U1406401]; China Scholarship Council (CSC); International Pacific Research Center (IPRC)","Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center - Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; National Research Foundation of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory (GRL) grant of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST); NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); International Pacific Research Center (IPRC)","This work was jointly supported by the Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center (which is sponsored by Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology), the National Research Foundation of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory (GRL) grant of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST, 2011-0021927), and the NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Science Research Centers (Grant U1406401).

A common radiation code is used to calculate 2 alternative breakdowns. The conventional breakdown, into surface temperature feedback, lapse rate feedback and water vapor feedback shows only the well-known result of large but mostly compensating variations in the latter two components, due to variations in the distribution of warming. In one GCM, lambda(CSLW) is rather stronger than the rest, tending to reduce the sensitivity of climate. The partly Simpsonian breakdown shows that this is because of a combination of having less water vapor to start with and less increase in water vapor around the tropopause on warming. Two GCMs show lambda(CSLW) rather weaker than the rest, because of weaker amplification of the warming aloft, in one case combined with stronger-than-average relative humidity increases. The net effect of greater lapse rate changes (proportionally more warming aloft) can be seen to tend consistently to reduce climate sensitivity slightly. Also, though the impact of relative humidity changes is dominated by reductions through most of the depth of the troposphere, its variation across GCMs is dominated by increases around the tropopause. While the results from so small a sample will not be quantitatively general, they suggest that applying the new breakdown to a much wider range of GCMs would give useful quantitative and physical information on the variation of lambda(CSLW) across current GCMs.","[Ingram, W.

Juglans neotropica is native to South America; it is found from 1800 m to 2800 m in altitude, in dry and humid low montane forests. It is a species of alternate composite leaves, monoecious, with cross-pollination and anemophilous, dispersed by animals and water, with annual reproduction. Currently, it is cataloged in danger of extinction (EN A2cd) since 52% of its populations are over exploited for purposes of producing timber. The uses of the species make it promising; its wood is one of the most valuable in the world because of the fact that active substances with potential for the textile industry, medicine and human food have been found in all of its parts; it has been used as an excellent source of firewood in rural areas. This species is key in the adaptation to the climate change because of its environmental services in the ecological recovery of degraded soils, and for maintaining the quality of air and water under agroforestry systems that, at the same time, are a habitat and source of food resources for wildlife. Also it is important as ornamental in urbanized Andean landscapes. Because of all those arguments, a propagation proposal is made as a conservation measure in Andean zones, based on documented studies for the species.","[Toro Vanegas, Esau; Roldan Rojas, Isabel Cristina] Fdn Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Ambientales, Antioquia, Colombia",,"Vanegas, ET (corresponding author), Fdn Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Ambientales, Antioquia, Colombia.",esau.toro@gmail.com,,,,,,,89,3,3,1,5,INST ECOLOGIA A C,XALAPA,"KM 2 5 CARR ANT A COATEPEC NO 351, CONGREGACION EL HAYA, XALAPA, VER 00000, MEXICO",2448-7597,,,MADERA BOSQUES,Madera Bosques,SPR,2018,1,,,,,,UNSP e2411560,10.21829/myb.2018.2411560,http://dx.doi.org/10.21829/myb.2018.2411560,,,15,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,GY6DM,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000448675600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we employ a method based on water mass transformation theory for inferring changes in the water cycle from changes in three-dimensional salinity. Using full depth salinity observations we infer a water cycle amplification of 3.0 +/- 1.6%degrees C-1 over 1950-2010.

The main difference with respect to CLIMBER-2 is its oceanic component, which has been replaced by a state-of-the-art ocean model, which includes an ocean general circulation model (GCM), a biogeochemistry module, and a state-of-the-art sea-ice model. Thus, CLIMBER-3 alpha includes modules describing the atmosphere, land-surface scheme, terrestrial vegetation, ocean, sea ice, and ocean biogeochemistry. Owing to Its relatively simple atmospheric component, it is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than coupled GCMs, allowing the performance of a much larger number of integrations and sensitivity studies as well as longer ones. At the same time its oceanic component confers on it a larger degree of realism compared to those EMICs which include simpler oceanic components. The coupling does not include heat or freshwater flux corrections. The comparison against the climatologies shows that CLIMBER-3 alpha satisfactorily describes the large-scale characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice on seasonal timescales. As a result of the tracer advection scheme employed, the ocean component satisfactorily simulates the large-scale oceanic circulation with very little numerical and explicit vertical diffusion. The model is thus suited for the study of the large-scale climate and large-scale ocean dynamics. We herein describe its performance for present-day boundary conditions. In a companion paper (Part II), the sensitivity of the model to variations in the external forcing, as well as the role of certain model parameterisations and internal parameters, will be analysed.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Fis, Dpto Astrofis & Ciencias Atmosfera, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Complutense University of Madrid; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Montoya, M (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Fis, Dpto Astrofis & Ciencias Atmosfera, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",mmontoya@fis.ucm.es,"Levermann, Anders/G-4666-2011; Mignot, Juliette/F-3138-2011; Rahmstorf, Stefan/A-8465-2010; Ganopolski, Andrey/F-6811-2013","Levermann, Anders/0000-0003-4432-4704; Mignot, Juliette/0000-0002-4894-898X; Rahmstorf, Stefan/0000-0001-6786-7723; ",,,,,85,80,80,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Location Northern Australia, Australian Monsoon Tropics (AMT). The AMT is defined by areas that receive more than 85% of rainfall between November and April. Methods Literature is summarized, including the origin of the monsoon climate, present-day environment, biota and habitat types, and phylogenetic and geographical relationships of selected organisms. Results Some species are widespread throughout the AMT while others are narrow-range endemics. Such contrasting distributions correspond to present-day climates, hydrologies (particularly floodplains), geological features (such as sandstone plateaux), fire regimes, and vegetation types (ranging from rain forest to savanna). Biogeographical and phylogenetic studies of terrestrial plants (e.g. eucalypts) and animals (vertebrates and invertebrates) suggest that distinct bioregions within the AMT reflect the aggregated effects of landscape and environmental history, although more research is required to determine and refine the boundaries of biogeographical zones within the AMT. Phylogenetic analyses of aquatic organisms (fishes and prawns) suggest histories of associations with drainage systems, dispersal barriers, links to New Guinea, and the existence of Lake Carpentaria, now submerged by the Gulf of Carpentaria. Complex adaptations to the landscape and climate in the AMT are illustrated by a number of species. Main conclusions The Australian monsoon is a component of a single global climate system, characterized by a dominant equator-spanning Hadley cell. Evidence of hot, seasonally moist climates dates back to the Late Eocene, implying that certain endemic elements of the AMT biota have a long history. Vicariant differentiation is inferred to have separated the Kimberley and Arnhem Land bioregions from Cape York Peninsula/northern Queensland. Such older patterns are overlaid by younger events, including dispersal from Southeast Asia, and range expansions and contractions. Future palaeoecological and phylogenetic investigations will illuminate the evolution of the AMT biome. Understanding the biogeography of the AMT is essential to provide a framework for ecological studies and the sustainable development of the region.","[Bowman, D. M. J.

However, this chronology is inconsistent with inferred habitat preferences of mastodons and correlative paleoecological evidence. To establish a last appearance date (LAD) for M. americanum regionally, we obtained 53 new C-14 dates on 36 fossils, including specimens with previously published dates. Using collagen ultrafiltration and single amino acid (hydroxyproline) methods, these specimens consistently date to beyond or near the similar to 50,000 y B.P. limit of C-14 dating. Some erroneously young C-14 dates are due to contamination by exogenous carbon from natural sources and conservation treatments used in museums. We suggest mastodons inhabited the high latitudes only during warm intervals, particularly the Last Interglacial [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5] when boreal forests existed regionally. Our C-14 dataset suggests that mastodons were extirpated from eastern Beringia during the MIS 4 glacial interval (similar to 75,000 y ago), following the ecological shift from boreal forest to steppe tundra. Mastodons thereafter became restricted to areas south of the continental ice sheets, where they suffered complete extinction similar to 10,000 C-14 years B.P. Mastodons were already absent from eastern Beringia several tens of millennia before the first humans crossed the Bering Isthmus or the onset of climate changes during the terminal Pleistocene. Local extirpations of mastodons and other megafaunal populations in eastern Beringia were asynchrononous and independent of their final extinction south of the continental ice sheets.","[Zazula, Grant D.] Govt Yukon, Dept Tourism & Culture, Yukon Palaeontol Program, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2C6, Canada; [MacPhee, Ross D.

The experiments are designed to quantify the separate effects of GHGs and ODSs on the evolution of ozone, as well as the extent to which these effects are independent of each other, by alternately holding one set of these two forcings constant in combination with a third experiment where both ODSs and GHGs vary. We estimate that up to the year 2000 the net decrease in the column amount of ozone above 20 hPa is approximately 75% of the decrease that can be attributed to ODSs due to the offsetting effects of cooling by increased CO2. Over the 21st century, as ODSs decrease, continued cooling from CO2 is projected to account for more than 50% of the projected increase in ozone above 20 hPa. Changes in ozone below 20 hPa show a redistribution of ozone from tropical to extra-tropical latitudes with an increase in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. In addition to a latitudinal redistribution of ozone, we find that the globally averaged column amount of ozone below 20 hPa decreases over the 21st century, which significantly mitigates the effect of upper stratospheric cooling on total column ozone. Analysis by linear regression shows that the recovery of ozone from the effects of ODSs generally follows the decline in reactive chlorine and bromine levels, with the exception of the lower polar stratosphere where recovery of ozone in the second half of the 21st century is slower than would be indicated by the decline in reactive chlorine and bromine concentrations. These results also reveal the degree to which GHG-related effects mute the chemical effects of N2O on ozone in the standard future scenario used for the WMO Ozone Assessment. Increases in the residual circulation of the atmosphere and chemical effects from CO2 cooling more than halve the increase in reactive nitrogen in the mid to upper stratosphere that results from the specified increase in N2O between 1950 and 2100.","[Plummer, D.

MC deforestation is known to have a considerable influence on the local climate. However, its possible teleconnections to other regions are less understood. In this study, the influence of MC deforestation on precipitation over southern China is investigated using both reanalysis data and state-of-the-art climate models. The results show that MC deforestation could strengthen the late winter and early spring precipitation decline over southern China during 1979-2019. The enhanced regional convection due to MC deforestation leads to anomalous northward shifting of the tropical meridional circulation, with the ascending branch at 0 degrees-10 degrees N and descending at 20 degrees-30 degrees N compared with climatological ascending (10 degrees S-0 degrees) and descending (10 degrees-20 degrees N) branches. Such circulation change suppresses the moisture convergence and the development of convection over southern China. Our results suggest that, in addition to the local effects of deforestation, a further investigation of the remote impacts is essential for a thorough understanding of the climate influences of ongoing MC deforestation.","[Wei, Shengbiao; Wang, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzho, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad South China Sea Ecol & Environm Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xie, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Sanya, Peoples R China; [Xie, Qiang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Xie, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wei, Shengbiao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Hong Kong Branch of the Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Deep-Sea Science & Engineering, CAS; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Wang, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Wang, X (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzho, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Wang, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad South China Sea Ecol & Environm Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Xie, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Sanya, Peoples R China.;Xie, Q (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Xie, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",wangxin@scsio.ac.cn; gordonxie@idsse.ac.cn,"Wang, Xin/B-4624-2012","Wang, Xin/0000-0002-7323-2289; Wei, Shengbiao/0000-0003-2653-0010","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41925024]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB42000000, XDA20060502]; Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) [GML2019ZD0306]; Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences [ISEE2021ZD01]; China-Sri Lanka Joint Center for Education and Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); Innovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences; China-Sri Lanka Joint Center for Education and Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41925024), the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant Nos.

Here, concurrently measured wind fields and satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration, along with a state-of-the-art ocean model simulation, spanning 2008-18 are used to investigate the connection between coastal and offshore physical drivers of the Benguela upwelling system (BUS). Our results indicate that the spatial structure of long-term mean upwelling derived from Ekman theory and the numerical model is fairly consistent across the entire BUS and is closely followed by the chlorophyll-a pattern. The variability of the upwelling from the Ekman theory is proportionally diminished with offshore distance, whereas different and sometimes opposite structures are revealed in the model-derived upwelling. Our result suggests the presence of submesoscale activity (i.e., filaments and eddies) across the entire BUS with a large modulating effect on the wind-stress-curl-driven upwelling off Luderitz and Walvis Bay. In Kunene and Cape Frio upwelling cells, located in the northern sector of the BUS, the coastal upwelling and open-ocean upwelling frequently alternate each other, whereas they are modulated by the annual cycle and are mostly in phase off Walvis Bay. Such a phase relationship appears to be strongly seasonally dependent off Luderitz and across the southern BUS. Thus, our findings suggest that this relationship is far more complex than is currently thought and seems to be sensitive to climate changes, with short- and far-reaching consequences for this vulnerable marine ecosystem.","[Bordbar, Mohammad Hadi; Mohrholz, Volker; Schmidt, Martin] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Wamemiinde IOW, Rostock, Germany",,"Bordbar, MH (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Wamemiinde IOW, Rostock, Germany.",hadi.bordbar@io-warnemuende.de,"Bordbar, Mohammad Hadi/ABA-5579-2021","Bordbar, Mohammad Hadi/0000-0002-1258-0087","BMBF [EVAR-03F0814, 03F0795B]",BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This study was conducted within the frame of the EVAR project sponsored by the BMBF with the reference number EVAR-03F0814.

One way to handle this issue is by using paving materials that absorb less amount of heat and provide lower surface temperatures. This paper identifies several pavement materials with low surface temperatures for potential use in a tropical climate. The study was conducted in Putrajaya, Malaysia. Paving materials selected were Blue Impala polished granite (BIPG), Rosa Tanggo polished granite (RTPG), Fontana concrete (FC), and asphalt (AS) based on their popularity of use locally. Surface temperatures of these materials were measured using infrared thermal imaging camera in three different environments namely open space (OS), near water (NW), and under shade (US). The readings were recorded for 28 consecutive days from 6:00 to 24:00. Results indicate that BIPG was 15.5 degrees C cooler than AS during 12:00-15:00 in OS locations. However, BIPG and RTPG surface temperatures increased in NW locations as compared to OS and US locations from 12:00 to 18:00.

We derive a dynamical model for such drift, and after validating it we show that including a recalibrated version of the model in a postprocessing framework is able to significantly augment the skill of initialized predictions beyond that achieved by a use of current techniques of postprocessing alone.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has been suggested as an option to partially reverse climate change and to return the Earth system to a less dangerous state after a period of temperature overshoot. Whether or to what extent such partial reversal of climate change under CDR would happen is, next to socio-economic feasibility and sustainability, key to assessing CDR as a mitigation option. Here, we use a state-of-the-art Earth system model that includes a representation of permafrost carbon to investigate the reversibility of the Earth system after overshoots of different durations and magnitudes in idealized simulations. We find that atmospheric CO2 concentrations are slightly lower after an overshoot, compared to a reference simulation without overshoot, due to a near-perfect compensation of carbon losses from land by increased ocean carbon uptake during the overshoot periods. The legacy of an overshoot is, on a centennial timescale, indiscernible (within natural variability) from a reference case without overshoot for many aspects of the Earth system including global average surface temperature, marine and terrestrial productivity, strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, surface ocean pH, surface O2 concentration, and permafrost extent, except in the most extreme overshoot scenario considered in this study. Consistent with previous studies, we find irreversibility in permafrost carbon and deep ocean properties like seawater temperature, pH, and O2 concentrations. We do not find any indication of tipping points or self-reinforcing feedbacks that would put the Earth system on a significantly different trajectory after an overshoot. Hence, the effectiveness of CDR in partially reversing large-scale patterns of climate change might not be the main issue of CDR but rather the impacts and risks that would occur during the period of elevated temperatures during the overshoot.","[Schwinger, Joerg; Asaadi, Ali; Steinert, NormanJulius; Lee, Hanna] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Climate & Environm, Bergen, Norway; [Lee, Hanna] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway",Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Schwinger, J (corresponding author), Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, NORCE Climate & Environm, Bergen, Norway.",jorg.schwinger0@gmail.com,"Asaadi, Ali/ABE-5643-2020","Asaadi, Ali/0000-0002-3222-2789; Steinert, Norman J./0000-0002-2154-5857",,,,,66,0,0,1,1,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2190-4979,2190-4987,,EARTH SYST DYNAM,Earth Syst.

Often conflicting results and generally too short observations are, however, still challenging our understanding of climate-induced treeline dynamics. Here, we use a state-of-the-art dendroecological approach to reconstruct long-term changes in the position of the alpine treeline in relation to air temperature at two sides in the Changbai Mountains in northeast China. Over the past 160 years, the treeline increased by around 80 m, a process that can be divided into three phases of different rates and drives. The first phase was mainly influenced by vegetation recovery after an eruption of the Tianchi volcano in 1702. The slowly upward shift in the second phase was consistent with the slowly increasing temperature. The last phase coincided with rapid warming since 1985, and shows with 33 m per 1 degrees C, the most intense upward shift. The spatial distribution and age structure of trees beyond the current treeline confirm the latest, warming-induced upward shift. Our results suggest that the alpine treeline will continue to rise, and that the alpine tundra may disappear if temperatures will increase further. This study not only enhances mechanistic understanding of long-term treeline dynamics, but also highlights the effects of rising temperatures on high-elevation vegetation dynamics.","[Du, Haibo; Liu, Jie; Yang, Yue; Wang, Lei; Wu, Zhengfang; He, Hong S.] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Li, Mai-He; Buntgen, Ulf] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Li, Mai-He] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Buntgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge, England; [Buntgen, Ulf] Masaryk Univ, Dept Geog, Brno, Czech Republic; [Buntgen, Ulf] Global Change Res Inst CAS, Brno, Czech Republic; [Wang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [He, Hong S.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA","Northeast Normal University - China; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; University of Cambridge; Masaryk University Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Global Change Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia","Wu, ZF; He, HS (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wuzf@nenu.edu.cn; hehs100@nenu.edu.cn,"Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013","Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; He, Hong S./0000-0002-3983-2512; Yue, Yang/0000-0001-8914-8543","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601052, 41471085, 41371076]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M600225]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2412016KJ025]; Youth and Sports of Czech Republic [LO1415]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Youth and Sports of Czech Republic,"National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFA0602301; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41601052, 41471085, 41371076; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2016M600225; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2412016KJ025; Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I, Grant/Award Number: LO1415",,63,54,62,26,172,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

While the effects of changing temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on the synthesis and emission of isoprene, the most abundant of these bVOCs, are well known, the role of other environmental factors such as soil moisture stress are not fully understood and are therefore poorly represented in land surface models. As part of the Wytham Isoprene iDirac Oak Tree Measurements campaign, continuous measurements of isoprene mixing ratio were made throughout the summer of 2018 in Wytham Woods, a mixed deciduous woodland in southern England. During this time, the United Kingdom experienced a prolonged heatwave and drought, and isoprene mixing ratios were observed to increase by more than 400% at Wytham Woods under these conditions. We applied the state-of-the-art FORest Canopy-Atmosphere Transfer canopy exchange model to investigate the processes leading to these elevated concentrations. We found that although current isoprene emissions algorithms reproduced observed mixing ratios in the canopy before and after the heatwave, the model underestimated observations by similar to 40% during the heatwave-drought period implying that models may substantially underestimate the release of isoprene to the atmosphere in future cases of mild or moderate drought. Stress-induced emissions of isoprene based on leaf temperature and soil water content (SWC) were incorporated into current emissions algorithms leading to significant improvements in model output. A combination of SWC, leaf temperature and rewetting emission bursts provided the best model-measurement fit with a 50% improvement compared to the baseline model. Our results highlight the need for more long-term ecosystem-scale observations to enable improved model representation of atmosphere-biosphere interactions in a changing global climate.","[Otu-Larbi, Frederick; Wild, Oliver; Ashworth, Kirsti] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Bolas, Conor G.; Staniaszek, Zosia; Jones, Roderic L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge, England; [Ferracci, Valerio; Harris, Neil R.

Thus, the history of climate and environments in this basin contributes significantly to our understanding of the conditions under which early humans spread into Europe during the Early Pleistocene. Here we present estimates of precipitation and primary productivity in the GBB from the Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene based on dental ecometrics in fossil communities of large herbivorous mammals, and perform an ecometrics-based distribution modelling to analyse the environmental conditions of Early and Middle Pleistocene human sites in Europe. Our results show that Early Pleistocene humans generally occupied on average relatively diverse habitats with ecotones, such as woodlands and savannas, but avoided very open and harsh (cool or dry) environments. During the Middle Pleistocene in Europe, humans occupied a comparatively much broader range of environments than during the Early Pleistocene, but were on average more concentrated in environments where the dental ecometric of mammals indicate wooded palaeoenvironments. In the earliest human occupation sites of the GBB, Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3, the mean annual precipitation and net primary production estimates indicate climatic conditions close to modern Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland environments, but with slightly higher primary productivity, indicating some similarity with East African woodlands. On the other hand, the environments did not resemble African grassland savannas. The browse-dominated diets of ungulates from Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3 further suggest palaeoenvironments where grasses were a minor component of the vegetation. In the slightly older site of Venta Micena that has no evidence for the presence of hominins, dental ecometric estimates indicate climate and environments similar to Mediterranean forest steppe environments existing in the surroundings of Baza today. Grasses were prevalent in the diet of some taxa, especially equids, in Venta Micena, but most of the species show browse-dominated diets even there. (C) 2021 The Authors.

However, we presently lack a systematic understanding of how vegetation responds to asymmetric seasonal environmental changes. In this study, we first investigated trends in the seasonal mean leaf area index (LAI) at northern latitudes (north of 30 degrees N) between 1982 and 2009 using three remotely sensed long-term LAI data sets. The most significant LAI increases occurred in summer (0.009 m(2) m(-2) year(-1), p<.01), followed by autumn (0.005 m(2) m(-2) year(-1), p<.01) and spring (0.003 m(2) m(-2) year(-1), p<.01). We then quantified the contribution of elevating atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO(2)), climate change, nitrogen deposition, and land cover change to seasonal LAI increases based on factorial simulations from 10 state-of-the-art ecosystem models. Unlike previous studies that used multimodel ensemble mean (MME), we used the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to optimize the integration of model ensemble. The optimally integrated ensemble LAI changes are significantly closer to the observed seasonal LAI changes than the traditional MME results. The BMA factorial simulations suggest that eCO(2) provides the greatest contribution to increasing LAI trends in all seasons (0.003-0.007 m(2) m(-2) year(-1)), and is the main factor driving asymmetric seasonal LAI trends. Climate change controls the spatial pattern of seasonal LAI trends and dominates the increase in seasonal LAI in the northern high latitudes. The effects of nitrogen deposition and land use change are relatively small in all seasons (around 0.0002 m(2) m(-2) year(-1) and 0.0001-0.001 m(2) m(-2) year(-1), respectively). Our analysis of the seasonal LAI responses to the interactions between seasonal changes in environmental factors offers a new perspective on the response of global vegetation to environmental changes.","[Zhu, Zaichun; Piao, Shilong; Lian, Xu; Peng, Shushi; Yang, Hui] Peking Univ, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Myneni, Ranga B.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Boston University","Piao, SL (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sinofrench Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",slpiao@pku.edu.cn,"Zhu, Zaichun/I-5374-2014; PENG, Shushi/AAS-2603-2020; Myneni, Ranga B./AAU-6088-2021; Myneni, Ranga B/F-5129-2012; Peng, Shushi/J-4779-2014; Zhu, Zaichun/ABD-2040-2021","Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; PENG, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X; Myneni, Ranga B/0000-0002-0234-6393; Peng, Shushi/0000-0001-5098-726X; Zhu, Zaichun/0000-0001-5235-5194; Lian, Xu/0000-0002-1428-3529",National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41561134016]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China,National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China,"National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2013CB956303; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41561134016; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China",,88,29,35,12,139,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The well-studied transition from the Lateglacial to early Holocene (ca. 16-10 ka) contains several abrupt climatic shifts, making this period ideal for assessing the spatio-temporal structure of climate change. However, comparisons of timings of past climatic events among regions often remain hypothetical because site-specific age scales are not necessarily synchronised to each other. Here we present new pollen data (n = 510) and mean annual temperature reconstruction from the annually laminated sediments of Lake Suigetsu, Japan. Suigetsu's C-14 dataset is an integral component of the IntCal20 radiocarbon calibration model, in which the absolute age scale is established to the highest standard. Its exceptionally high-precision chronology, along with recent advances in cosmogenic isotope studies of ice cores, enables temporally coherent comparisons among Suigetsu, Greenland, and other key proxy records across regions. We show that the onsets of the Lateglacial cold reversal (equivalent to GS-1/Younger Dryas) and the Holocene were synchronous between East Asia and the North Atlantic, whereas the Lateglacial interstadial (equivalent to GI-1/Bolling-Allerod) started ca. two centuries earlier in East Asia than in the North Atlantic. Bimodal migration (or 'jump') of the westerly jet between north and south of the Tibetan plateau and Himalayas may have operated as a threshold system responsible for the abruptness of the change in East and South (and possibly also West) Asia. That threshold in Asia and another major threshold in the North Atlantic, associated with switching on/off of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), were crossed at different times, producing a multi-centennial asynchrony of abrupt changes, as well as a disparity of climatic modes among regions during the transitional phases. Such disparity may have disturbed zonal circulation and generated unstable climate during transitions. The intervening periods with stable climate, on the other hand, coincided with the beginnings of sedentary life and agriculture, implying that these new lifestyles and technologies were not rational unless climate was stable and thus, to a certain extent, predictable.","[Nakagawa, Takeshi; Kitaba, Ikuko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Res Ctr Palaeoclimatol, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Nakagawa, Takeshi] Univ Newcastle, Dept Geog, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tarasov, Pavel] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Geol Sci, Paleontol, D-12249 Berlin, Germany; [Staff, Richard; Ramsey, Christopher Bronk] Univ Oxford, Res Lab Archaeol & Hist Art, Oxford OX1 3TG, England; [Staff, Richard; Bryant, Charlotte] Univ Glasgow, Scottish Univ Environm Res Ctr, E Kilbride G75 0QF, Lanark, Scotland; [Marshall, Michael; Lamb, Henry] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales; [Marshall, Michael] Univ Derby, Inst Educ, Derby DE22 1GB, England; [Schlolaut, Gordon; Brauer, Achim] German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Sect Climate Dynam & Landscape Evolut, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Lamb, Henry] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Bot Dept, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Haraguchi, Tsuyoshi] Osaka City Univ, Dept Biol & Geosci, Osaka 5588585, Japan; [Gotanda, Katsuya] Chiba Univ Commerce, Fac Global Studies, Chiba 2728512, Japan; [Kitagawa, Hiroyuki] Nagoya Univ, Inst Space Earth Environm Res, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [van der Plicht, Johannes] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst, Dept Isotope Res, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Yonenobu, Hitoshi] Naruto Univ Educ, Coll Educ, Naruto 7728502, Japan; [Omori, Takayuki] Univ Tokyo, Univ Museum, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yusuke] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Tada, Ryuji] Univ Tokyo, Fac Sci, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yasuda, Yoshinori] Museum Nat & Environm Hist, Shizuoka, Shizuoka 4228017, Japan",Ritsumeikan University; Newcastle University - UK; Free University of Berlin; University of Oxford; Scottish Universities Research & Reactor Center; University of Glasgow; Aberystwyth University; University of Derby; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Potsdam GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences; Trinity College Dublin; Osaka Metropolitan University; Nagoya University; University of Groningen; Naruto University of Education; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo,"Nakagawa, T (corresponding author), Ritsumeikan Univ, Res Ctr Palaeoclimatol, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan.",nakag@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,"Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Marshall, Dr Michael/0000-0001-8279-7532","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/D000289/1, NE/F003048/1, NE/F003056/1, NE/F004400/1, 1219.0410]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [BR-2208/7, TA540/3]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-Japan (MEXT) [21101001, 16K13894, 15H02143, 18H03744]; John Fell Oxford University Press Research Fund [101/551]","UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology-Japan (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); John Fell Oxford University Press Research Fund","The authors thank Mr. Atsumi Kitamura of Seibushisui Co.

Under future climate projections it is often expected that the risk of wildfires will increase. Our ability to predict the magnitude and geographic pattern of future fire impacts rests on our ability to model fire regimes, using either well-founded empirical relationships or process-based models with good predictive skill. While a large variety of models exist today, it is still unclear which type of model or degree of complexity is required to model fire adequately at regional to global scales. This is the central question underpinning the creation of the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), an international initiative to compare and evaluate existing global fire models against benchmark data sets for present-day and historical conditions. In this paper we review how fires have been represented in fire-enabled dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and give an overview of the current state of the art in fire-regime modelling. We indicate which challenges still remain in global fire modelling and stress the need for a comprehensive model evaluation and outline what lessons may be learned from FireMIP.","[Hantson, Stijn; Arneth, Almut] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Atmospher Environm Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Harrison, Sandy P.; Kelley, Douglas I.] Univ Reading, SAGES, Reading, Berks, England; [Harrison, Sandy P.; Kelley, Douglas I.; Prentice, I.

Within the EU integrated project Water and Global Change (WATCH), special care is taken to use state-of-the-art climate model output for impacts assessments with a suite of hydrological models. This coupling is expected to lead to a better assessment of changes in the hydrological cycle. However, given the systematic errors of climate models, their output is often not directly applicable as input for hydrological models. Thus, the methodology of a statistical bias correction has been developed for correcting climate model output to produce long-term time series with a statistical intensity distribution close to that of the observations. As observations, global reanalyzed daily data of precipitation and temperature were used that were obtained in the WATCH project. Daily time series from three GCMs (GCMs) ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM), Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Coupled GCM, version 3 (CNRM-CM3), and the atmospheric component of the L'Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model, version 4 (IPSL CM4) coupled model (called LMDZ-4)-were bias corrected. After the validation of the bias-corrected data, the original and the bias-corrected GCM data were used to force two global hydrology models (GHMs): 1) the hydrological model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-HM) consisting of the simplified land surface (SL) scheme and the hydrological discharge (HD) model, and 2) the dynamic global vegetation model called LPJmL. The impact of the bias correction on the projected simulated hydrological changes is analyzed, and the simulation results of the two GHMs are compared. Here, the projected changes in 2071-2100 are considered relative to 1961-90. It is shown for both GHMs that the usage of bias-corrected GCM data leads to an improved simulation of river runoff for most catchments. But it is also found that the bias correction has an impact on the climate change signal for specific locations and months, thereby identifying another level of uncertainty in the modeling chain from the GCM to the simulated changes calculated by the GHMs. This uncertainty may be of the same order of magnitude as uncertainty related to the choice of the GCM or GHM. Note that this uncertainty is primarily attached to the GCM and only becomes obvious by applying the statistical bias correction methodology.","[Hagemann, Stefan; Chen, Cui; Haerter, Jan O.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Heinke, Jens; Gerten, Dieter] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Piani, Claudio] Abdus Salam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy",Max Planck Society; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),"Hagemann, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",stefan.hagemann@zmaw.de,"Gerten, Dieter/B-2975-2013; Haerter, Jan/I-4410-2012","Gerten, Dieter/0000-0002-6214-6991; Haerter, Jan O/0000-0002-8617-3847",European Union [036946],European Union(European Commission),This study was supported by funding from the European Union within the WATCH project (Contract 036946).

It has been suggested that more warming in the upper-troposphere than the lower-troposphere should exert a dampening effect on the sea surface warming associated with the negative lapse rate feedback. This study, however, demonstrates that the tropical upper-tropospheric warming (UTW) tends to trap more moisture in the lower troposphere and weaken the surface wind speed, both contributing to reduce the upward surface latent heat flux so as to trigger the initial sea surface warming. We refer to this as a 'top-down' warming mechanism. The rise of tropospheric moisture together with the positive water vapor feedback enhance the downward longwave radiation to the surface and facilitate strengthening the initial sea surface warming. Meanwhile, the rise of sea surface temperature (SST) can feed back to intensify the initial UTW through the moist adiabatic adjustment, completing a positive UTW-SST warming feedback. The proposed 'top-down' warming mechanism and the associated positive UTW-SST warming feedback together affect the surface global warming rate and also have important implications for understanding the past and future changes of precipitation, clouds and atmospheric circulations.","[Xiang, Baoqiang; Wang, Bin; Lauer, Axel] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Meteorol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lee, June-Yi] Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Environm Studies, Pusan, South Korea; [Ding, Qinghua] Univ Washington, Quaternary Res Ctr, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System; Pusan National University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Xiang, BQ (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",baoqiang@hawaii.edu,"Lee, June-Yi/D-5752-2012; ding, qinghua/G-1186-2011; Xiang, Baoqiang/O-1890-2019; Lee, June-Yi/AAT-3407-2021","Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753; Lee, June-Yi/0000-0002-3986-9753","International Pacific Research Center; JAMSTEC; NOAA; NASA; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [MEST 2011-0021927]; MEST Brain Pool program","International Pacific Research Center; JAMSTEC; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Ministry of Education, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of Korea); MEST Brain Pool program(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of Korea)","The authors thank Shang-Ping Xie, Qiang Fu, Tim Li and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

In future, oil might still be available at higher prices than today, but the climate change implications of oil use will remain. As evidenced by the continued rise in global transport GHG emissions, conventional proposed solutions for mitigation are not working. Accordingly, this paper examines whether the new information technologies can contribute in a major way to the environmental sustainability of global passenger transport. The main finding is that the two technologies considered here-travel substitution and smart cities-could potentially increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, both travel substitution and smart transport, if given the right policy support, could be important means for enabling people and organisations to cope with the need for reduced travel in a climate constrained future.

This study exploits the recently completed phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and examines 27 state-of-the-art climate models to determine if their projected changes in the midlatitude circulation are consistent with the hypothesized impact of Arctic amplification over North America and the North Atlantic. Under the largest future greenhouse forcing (RCP8.5), it is found that every model, in every season, exhibits Arctic amplification by 2100. At the same time, the projected circulation responses are either opposite in sign to those hypothesized or too widely spread among the models to discern any robust change. However, in a few seasons and for some of the circulation metrics examined, correlations are found between the model spread in Arctic amplification and the model spread in the projected circulation changes. Therefore, while the CMIP5 models offer some evidence that future Arctic warming may be able to modulate some aspects of the midlatitude circulation response in some seasons, the analysis herein leads to the conclusion that the net circulation response in the future is unlikely to be determined solely-or even primarily-by Arctic warming according to the sequence of events recently hypothesized.","[Barnes, Elizabeth A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Polvani, Lorenzo M.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, New York, NY USA",Colorado State University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Barnes, EA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, 1371 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",eabarnes@atmos.colostate.edu,"Polvani, Lorenzo M/E-5949-2011; Barnes, Elizabeth A/O-1790-2014","Barnes, Elizabeth A/0000-0003-4284-9320",U.S. National Science Foundation,U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank three anonymous reviewers for their comments that helped us improve an earlier version of this manuscript.

In fact, immunotherapy has been the target of several and recent studies in different types of cancer, namely in melanoma, a globally growing threat. Contributing to the increasing incidence of this cancer is climate change, particularly global warming of the past century, which has increased the tendency to spend more time outdoors and, consequently, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation. Among the most relevant risk factors for melanoma is the increase in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone layer depletion, one of the main factors responsible for the incidence of new cases. Anti-PD-1 agents like Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab allow a more effective treatment, enhancing the duration of the responses to therapy and prolonging the survival of the patient. However, recent studies about safety and tolerability have stated that, although these drugs present less adverse effects and toxicity, they may lead to specific autoimmune-mediated adverse events. Overall, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 agents represents a highly promising area in the treatment of some types of cancer such as melanoma.","[Moreira, Rita S.; Pereira, Andre M. P.

The safety of HTGRs results, among other, from the nature of the nuclear fuel used in them in the form of coated TRISO particles (tri-structural-isotropic) and the reduction of the total amount of radioactive waste generated. This paper reviews numerous methods used to ensure the sustainable, feasible management and long-term storage of HTGR nuclear waste for the protection of the environment and society. The types of waste generated in the HTGR cycle are presented as well as the methods of their characterization, which are important for long-time storage and final disposal. Two leading nuclear fuel cycle strategies, the once-through cycle (direct disposal or open cycle) and the twice-through cycle (recycling or partially closed cycle), are discussed also in relation to TRISO spent fuel.

Tools of image production and architectural propositions are employed to argue that the encounter between people and the planet should be recomposed to form new alliances with nature; cosmopolitical bodies. The research is loosely divided into two parts, research into prevailing imaginations of space and their counter-arguments and implications for creative practice; and a speculative design thesis titled 'Dandal Kura' exploring the potentials of space technologies on Earth. Based upon research around multispecies theory and critiques of scientific practice, the research does not propose a human agent being replaced by the environmental agent; but a balance or symbiosis of living, living with nature. Both real and imagined space exploration's influence on (ecological) architecture has historically been seen as an exercise in escaping environmental crisis and reinforcing dominant political narratives. In this context, an alternative imagination of space is considered to propose new architectures. An imagination of space that reflects multiplicities, is arguably female, and considers an ecological architecture that confronts the complexity of the social, environmental and political systems of the planet we inhabit; proposing ideas of settling and caring as alternatives to the mastery of nature. The project consists of a critique on the closed system conceptions of nature produced through imaginations of space exploration and locates Lake Chad as an 'Earth site' to test scales of ecological architectures: from the planetary system of the Lake as seen from space, to the microbiology of life-sustaining algaes growing in the wadis. The Lake Chad design project takes the name of Dandul Kura (meeting place) and speculates on the impact of series of interventions where space technologies allow women's cooperatives around Lake Chad to adapt with climate change. Through the intersection of scientific and indigenous knowledge, the project of Dandul Kura proposes that space technologies can become an emancipatory tool in the context of climatic crisis. The design proposal is conveyed through a series of images, reimagining modes of living in Lake Chad in this context of climate change and economic and environmental scarcity.","[Patrick, Mikaela] Royal Coll Art, Sch Architecture, London SW7 2EU, England",Royal College of Art - UK,"Patrick, M (corresponding author), Royal Coll Art, Sch Architecture, London SW7 2EU, England.",mikaela.patrick@network.rca.ac.uk,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0094-5765,1879-2030,,ACTA ASTRONAUT,Acta Astronaut.,APR,2019,,,,,215,224,,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.12.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.12.003,,,10,"Engineering, Aerospace",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering,HT3SB,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000464482400020,View Full Record in Web of Science

A quantitative assessment of greenhouse energy consumption and of its variability in space and time is an important decision support tool for both greenhouse-sector policies and farmers. A mathematical model of greenhouse energy balance was developed and parameterized for a state-of-the-art greenhouse to evaluate the heating requirements for vegetables growing. Tomato was adopted as reference crop, due to its high energy requirement for fruit setting and ripening and its economic relevance. In order to gain a proper description of the Euro-Mediterranean area, 56 greenhouse areas located within the ranges 28 degrees N-72 degrees N and 11 degrees W-55 degrees E were analyzed over the period 1973-2014. Moreover, the two 1973-1987 and 1988-2014 sub-periods were separately studied to describe climate change effects on energy consumption. Results account for the spatial variability of energy needs for tomato growing, highlighting the strong influence of latitude on the magnitude of heat requirements. The comparison between the two selected sub-periods shows a decrease of energy demand in the current warm phase, more relevant for high latitudes. Finally, suggestions to reduce energy consumptions are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

The objective of this research is to estimate the hydrologic budget and sea surface heights of the Caspian Sea from 1998 to 2005 to assess the contribution of meteorological and geological process to the Caspian Sea level variations. The water budget of the Caspian Sea from 1998 to 2005 was calculated using the state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques and ground-truth data. The Sea Surface heights of the Caspian Sea were constructed from the refined Topex/Poseidon altimetry data. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction/Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 meteorological data provided all the variables necessary for the Penman method to estimate evaporation over the Caspian Sea. The data of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission were utilized to estimate precipitation onto the Caspian Sea. A strong agreement between the water budget residuals and Caspian Sea level variations signifies that Caspian Sea level oscillations for this time window are essentially controlled by climate-related factors. On the other hand, the relatively larger gaps between the water balance residuals and Caspian Sea level heights during 2000 and 2001 may indicate an impact of seismicity on Caspian Sea level oscillations as a result of two major earthquakes on November 25, 2000.

In Cornwall, southwest England, a strong geomorphological signature is imparted by weathering of granite bedrock under cold Quaternary climates, and a strong cultural and heritage imprint is manifested in material and nonmaterial ways through archaeology, art, literature and folklore, and is illustrated in this paper through examples of Bodmin Moor (north Cornwall) and West Penwith (west Cornwall). Landscapes of Bodmin Moor include wide valleys with underfit rivers and upland summits with prominent tors, resulting from granite weathering and slope processes during the Tertiary and Quaternary. Pollen records show how human activity has changed on the moor over time, with a peak of settlement during the Bronze Age, and expansion of grazing into the Iron Age. Daphne du Maurier's novels, set on or adjacent to Bodmin Moor, emphasize the moor's relationship to unstable and intense human emotions and crises. In West Penwith, which is geomorphological similar to Bodmin Moor, geomorphology culture relations are demonstrated in different ways but through a similar sense of place and regional identity. The St Ives School of early 20th Century art, including the local artist Peter Lanyon and the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, draws inspiration from the local land and seascapes. The oral traditions and folklore of Zennor emphasize the importance of witchcraft and superstition that are in part founded on the wildness of upland summits and stormy coastline. Across West Penwith, tin mining and the mining trade exerted a strong impact on regional socioeconomic and cultural development from the Bronze Age until the end of the 19th Century, seen through settlement patterns, scientific innovation and Nonconformism. Today these geomorphology culture relations are memorialized in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While the emergence of the AMO sea surface temperature (SST) pattern has been conventionally attributed to the ocean heat transport, a recent study showed that the atmospheric stochastic forcing is sufficient. In this study, we resolve this conundrum by partitioning the multidecadal SST tendency into a part caused by surface heat fluxes and another by ocean dynamics, using a preindustrial control simulation of a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. In the model, horizontal ocean heat advection primarily acts to warm the subpolar SST as in previous studies; however, when the vertical component is also considered, the ocean dynamics overall acts to cool the region. Alternatively, the heat flux term is primarily responsible for the subpolar North Atlantic SST warming, although the associated surface heat flux anomalies are upward as observed. Further decomposition of the heat flux term reveals that it is the mixed layer depth (MLD) deepening that makes the ocean less susceptible for cooling, thus leading to relative warming by increasing the ocean heat capacity. This role of the MLD variability in the AMO signature had not been addressed in previous studies. The MLD variability is primarily induced by the anomalous salinity transport by the Gulf Stream modulated by the multidecadal North Atlantic Oscillation, with turbulent fluxes playing a secondary role. Thus, depending on how we interpret the MLD variability, our results support the two previously suggested frameworks, yet slightly modifying the previous notions.","[Yamamoto, Ayako; Tatebe, Hiroaki; Nonaka, Masami] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Yamamoto, A (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",ayako.yamamoto@jamstec.go.jp,"Nonaka, Masami/G-3417-2014","Yamamoto, Ayako/0000-0002-4997-0652; tatebe, hiroaki/0000-0002-2265-5847","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [JP18K13615, JP19H05701, JP18H03726, 15H05825, 19H01962]; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU Program) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU Program) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)","WethankDrs.

The analysis is based on a seamless transient simulation with a state-of-the-art fully coupled Earth system model from 850 to 2100 CE. The Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario is used in the 21st century. During the Common Era, cyclone characteristics show pronounced variations on interannual and decadal timescales, but no external forcing imprint is found prior to 1850. Thus, variations of extratropical cyclone characteristics are mainly caused by internal variability of the coupled climate system. When anthropogenic forcing becomes dominant in the 20th century, a decrease of the cyclone occurrences mainly over the Mediterranean and a strong increase of extreme cyclone-related precipitation become detectable. The latter is due to thermodynamics as it follows the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. An important finding, though, is that the relation between temperature and extreme cyclone-related precipitation is not always controlled by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which suggests that dynamical processes can play an important role in generating extreme cyclone-related precipitation - for example, in the absence of anomalously warm background conditions. Thus, the importance of dynamical processes, even on decadal timescales, might explain the conundrum that proxy records suggest enhanced occurrence of precipitation extremes during rather cold periods in the past.","[Raible, Christoph C.; Messmer, Martina; Stocker, Thomas F.] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Raible, Christoph C.; Messmer, Martina; Stocker, Thomas F.] Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Lehner, Flavio] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Blender, Richard] Univ Hamburg, Meteorol Inst, Hamburg, Germany",University of Bern; University of Bern; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Hamburg,"Raible, CC (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland.;Raible, CC (corresponding author), Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",raible@climate.unibe.ch,"; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016","Messmer, Martina/0000-0001-6835-4508; Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602; Lehner, Flavio/0000-0003-4632-9701",Swiss National Science Foundation [18-001],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),This work is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 18-001).

For the early Earth, models of stellar evolution predict a solar energy input to the climate system that is about 25% lower than today. This would result in a completely frozen world over the first 2 billion years in the history of our planet if all other parameters controlling Earth's climate had been the same. Yet there is ample evidence for the presence of liquid surface water and even life in the Archean (3.8 to 2.5 billion years before present), so some effect (or effects) must have been compensating for the faint young Sun. A wide range of possible solutions have been suggested and explored during the last four decades, with most studies focusing on higher concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, or ammonia. All of these solutions present considerable difficulties, however, so the faint young Sun problem cannot be regarded as solved. Here I review research on the subject, including the latest suggestions for solutions of the faint young Sun problem and recent geochemical constraints on the composition of Earth's early atmosphere. Furthermore, I will outline the most promising directions for future research. In particular I would argue that both improved geochemical constraints on the state of the Archean climate system and numerical experiments with state-of-the-art climate models are required to finally assess what kept the oceans on the Archean Earth from freezing over completely.","Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Feulner, G (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",feulner@pik-potsdam.de,"Feulner, Georg/A-1933-2011","Feulner, Georg/0000-0001-9215-5517",,,,,276,163,165,8,172,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",8755-1209,1944-9208,,REV GEOPHYS,Rev.

Aerosol concentrations are strongly influenced by rainfall via wet removal. Global climate models have been used to quantify their climate and health effects. However, they commonly suffer from a well-known problem of 'too much light rain and too little heavy rain'. The impact of simulated rainfall intensities on aerosol burden at the global scale is still unclear. Here we show that rainfall intensity has profound impacts on aerosol burden, and light rain has a disproportionate control on it. By improving the representation of convection, the light-rain (1-20 mm d(-1)) frequency in two state-of-the-art global climate models is reduced. As a result, the aerosol burden is increased globally, especially over the tropics and subtropics, by as much as 0.3 in aerosol optical depth in tropical rain belts. It is attributed to the dominant contribution of light rain to the accumulated wet removal by its frequent occurrence despite its weak intensity. The implication of these findings is that understanding the nature of aerosol scavenging by rainfall is critical to aerosol-climate interaction and its impact on climate.","[Wang, Yong; Xia, Wenwen; Wang, Bin] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong; Xia, Wenwen; Wang, Bin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaohong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX USA; [Xie, Shaocheng; Tang, Qi; Ma, Hsi-Yen] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Lin, Wuyin] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Jiang, Yiquan] Nanjing Univ, Inst Climate & Global Change Res, Sch Atmospher Sci, CMA NJU Joint Lab Climate Predict Studies, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modelling Atmospher Sci & Geo, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guang J.] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; Nanjing University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography","Zhang, GJ (corresponding author), Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",gzhang@ucsd.edu,"Tang, Qi/C-1032-2011; Wang, Bin/P-9121-2014; Liu, Xiaohong/E-9304-2011; Wang, Bin/D-9724-2012; Xie, Shaocheng/D-2207-2013","Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2959-0203; Wang, Bin/0000-0001-7374-3786; Liu, Xiaohong/0000-0002-3994-5955; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-3133-7197; Zhang, Guang/0000-0002-9712-5226; Ma, Hsi-Yen/0000-0002-9628-1278; Xia, Wenwen/0000-0002-4615-6188; Wang, Yong/0000-0002-5831-9466; Xie, Shaocheng/0000-0001-8931-5145","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975126, 41605074]; US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program (BER) [DE-SC19373, DE-SC0016504]; US DOE by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project; DOE Regional and Global Model Analysis program area (RGMA); ASR's Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed (CAPT) project; Office of Science of the US DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program (BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US DOE by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Regional and Global Model Analysis program area (RGMA)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); ASR's Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed (CAPT) project; Office of Science of the US DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China grants 2017YFA0604000 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China grants 41975126 and 41605074.

Although thermal insulation can decrease cooling loads, the presence of thermal bridges, infiltrations, windows, and other openings pose a continuous challenge. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, for instance, most windows are made of aluminum, a thermal conductor. This paper uses two methods to evaluate the alternative solution of enveloping buildings, including windows, with a secondary layer. The first method involved small-scale models; two test rooms were built, with one (the reference room) being based on regular municipal thermal guidelines and the other (the enveloped room) including an extra, secondary surrounding layer. The second test staged a similar scenario via software simulation. Both sets of results showed a significant reduction in electricity consumption in the enveloped room, which became more notable as the weather grew hotter. At the high end of the temperature scale, the power consumption of the enveloped room was 47%-54% lower than that of the reference room. However, such a secondary building envelope would increase the width of the wall structure and present the downside of adding to construction costs. While adopting this system in Dubai may save the city an estimated 16.6% in electrical energy, based on current prices, a house would likely need between 10 and 15 years to recuperate the associated capital investment.

A NAWH is predicted by climate models during the 21st century, and its pattern is already emerging in observations. Despite the known key role of the North Atlantic surface temperatures in setting the Northern Hemisphere climate, the mechanisms behind the NAWH are still not fully understood. Using state-of-the-art climate models, we show that anthropogenic aerosol forcing opposes the formation of the NAWH (by leading to a local warming) and delays its emergence by about 30 years. In agreement with previous studies, we also demonstrate that the relative warming of the North Atlantic under aerosol forcing is due to changes in ocean heat fluxes, rather than air-sea fluxes. These results suggest that the predicted reduction in aerosol forcing during the 21st century may accelerate the formation of the NAWH.","[Dagan, Guy; Stier, Philip; Watson-Parris, Duncan] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Dagan, G (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England.",guy.dagan@physics.ox.ac.uk,"Stier, Philip/B-2258-2008; Watson-Parris, Duncan/HGF-0016-2022; Dagan, Guy/ABH-4574-2020","Stier, Philip/0000-0002-1191-0128; Watson-Parris, Duncan/0000-0002-5312-4950; Dagan, Guy/0000-0002-8391-6334","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [724602]; European Union [821205]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program iMIRACLI under H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (2020-2024) [860100]; NERC ACRUISE project [NE/S005390/1]; NERC [NE/S005390/1, NE/S005099/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union(European Commission); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program iMIRACLI under H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (2020-2024); NERC ACRUISE project; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) project constRaining the EffeCts of Aerosols on Precipitation (RECAP) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program with grant agreement 724602.

Similar to several other state-of-the-art GCMs, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulated by the GEOS-5 has a strong biennial periodicity. Since this is a model bias that precludes a strong role of ENSO, it provides a unique environment to assess the other leading mechanisms of North Pacific decadal variability. Despite the biennial ENSO periodicity, the model simulates a realistic PDO pattern in the North Pacific that is resolved as the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of winter mean sea surface temperature (SST). The spectrum of the PDO indicates no preferred periodicity. The SST anomalies associated with the PDO, particularly its basin wide structure, are primarily forced by the Aleutian low through Ekman transport. The slow geostrophic transport in association with the meridional adjustment of the subtropical gyre is limited to a narrow region in the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension, north of 40 degrees N. The atmosphere's response to the PDO, while weak, projects onto the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), a meridional dipole in sea level pressure. Both the lack of preferred periodicity and the weak atmospheric response indicate an air-sea coupled oscillation is an unlikely mechanism in this model. In agreement with recent studies, the NPO is correlated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, which is another leading EOF of North Pacific SST variability. The results emphasize the role of atmospheric variability in the North Pacific SST modes, thereby bringing into question the potential for their predictability.","[Achuthavarier, Deepthi; Vikhliaev, Yury V.] Univ Space Res Assoc, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res, Columbia, MD 21046 USA; [Achuthavarier, Deepthi; Schubert, Siegfried D.] NASA, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Code 610-1,Bldg 33, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA",Universities Space Research Association (USRA); National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Achuthavarier, D (corresponding author), Univ Space Res Assoc, Goddard Earth Sci Technol & Res, Columbia, MD 21046 USA.;Achuthavarier, D (corresponding author), NASA, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Code 610-1,Bldg 33, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.",deepthi.achuthavarier@nasa.gov,,,"NASA's Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Program","NASA's Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","This study was supported by NASA's Modeling, Analysis and Prediction Program.

From 1979 to 2006, September sea-ice extent decreased by almost 25% or about 100,000 km(2) per year (ref. 2). In September 2007, Arctic sea-ice extent reached its lowest level since satellite observations began(3) and in September 2008, sea-ice cover was still low. This development has raised concerns that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in late summer in only a few decades, with important economic and geopolitical implications. Unfortunately, most current climate models underestimate significantly the observed trend in Arctic sea-ice decline(4), leading to doubts regarding their projections for the timing of ice-free conditions. Here we analyse the simulated trends in past sea-ice cover in 18 state-of-art-climate models and find a direct relationship between the simulated evolution of September sea-ice cover over the twenty-first century and the magnitude of past trends in sea-ice cover. Using this relationship together with observed trends, we project the evolution of September sea-ice cover over the twenty-first century. We find that under a scenario with medium future greenhouse-gas emissions, the Arctic Ocean will probably be ice-free in September before the end of the twenty-first century.","[Boe, Julien; Hall, Alex; Qu, Xin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Dept, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Boe, JL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Dept, POB 951565, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",boe@atmos.ucla.edu,"Hall, Alex/D-8175-2014","Boe, Julien/0000-0003-2965-4721","NSF [ARC-0714083]; Office of Science, US Department of Energy","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Office of Science, US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors are supported by NSF ARC-0714083.

However, it was comparatively recently that the newly emerging science was given its name. The name of Charles Morren and the year 1853 are being cited, although not frequently. Exact information is hardly known among present-day phenologists, yet new evidence shows that the term phenology was already in use in 1849. In the early 1840s, physicist and astronomer Adolphe Quetelet set up an observational network named Observations of periodical Phenomena of the Animal and Vegetable Kingdom and issued instructions for it. Even though biologist Charles Morren welcomed Quetelet's initiative, differences between Morren and Quentlet regarding the instructions for the observations and the potential results soon arose and a debate started, which lasted for nearly 10 years. In the wake of these disagreements, Morren was compelled to create a new term to denote his ideas on periodical phenomena. At first, he temporally used the word anthochronology, but in the end he coined the word phenology. The term was first used in a public lecture at the Academie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique' in Brussels on 16 December 1849, and simultaneously in the December 1849 issue of volume V of the Annales de la Societe royale d'Agriculture et de Botanique de Gand. One had to wait until 1853 before the new name appeared in the title of one of Morren's publications. Based on evidence from archives and original publications, we trace the 10-year-long scientific debate between Morren and Quetelet. Morren states his biologist's view on the subject and extends the more climate-related definition of Quetelet of periodical phenomena.","[Rutishauser, This] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Rutishauser, This] Univ Bern, Oescher Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Demaree, Gaston R.] Royal Meteorol Inst, Brussels, Belgium; [Rutishauser, This] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat CREAF CEAB CSIC, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",University of Bern; University of Bern; Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB),"Rutishauser, T (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland.",gaston.demaree@oma.be; rutis@giub.unibe.ch,,,,,,,60,19,20,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

Approaches using spectral features of remote sensing (RS) images have been widely adopted to capture land surface patterns. However, challenges arise concerning the accurate classification of built areas due to high levels of heterogeneity. An effective way to address this issue is to incorporate spatial contextual information. Deep learning techniques have recently been applied to RS image classification, and impressive results have been reported. This research undertook a case study of Dongguan City, which is a core Chinese city characterised by high density and heterogeneity. A culturally neutral classification scheme called local climate zone was adopted for land surface classification. The default random forest classification was used as a benchmark, and the moving window approach and several pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models were also applied for comparison. The moving window approach achieved the highest mapping accuracy with a window size of 5 x 5. Although the CNN models failed to achieve state-of-the-art results, they still exhibited an excellent performance considering the small number of input features and small input patch size. They can also reduce the salt-and-pepper phenomenon effectively.

We examined the amplified Arctic warming over the past century simulated by 36 state-of-the-art GCMs against observation. We found a clear difference between the simulations and the observation in terms of the evolution of the secular warming rates. The observed rates of the secular Arctic warming increase from 0.14 degrees C/10a in the early 1890s to 0.21 degrees C/10a in the mid-2010s, while the GCMs show a negligible trend to 0.35 degrees C/10a at the corresponding times. The overestimation of the secular warming rate in the GCMs starts from the mid-twentieth century and aggravates with time. Further analysis indicates that the overestimation mainly comes from the exaggerated heating contribution from the Arctic sea ice melting.

In doing so, there is increasing recognition that such change is deeply uncertain and unable to be reliably described with probabilities or a small number of scenarios. Characteristics of methodologies applied in Australian practice to evaluate long-term coastal adaptation options are reviewed and benchmarked against two state-of-the-art international methods suited for conditions of uncertainty (Robust Decision Making and Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways). Seven out of the ten Australian case studies assumed the uncertain parameters, such as sea level rise, could be described deterministically or stochastically when identifying risk and evaluating adaptation options across multi-decadal periods. This basis is not considered sophisticated enough for long-term decision-making, implying that Australian practice needs to increase the use of scenarios to explore a much larger uncertainty space when assessing the performance of adaptation options. Two Australian case studies mapped flexible adaptation pathways to manage uncertainty, and there remains an opportunity to incorporate quantitative methodologies to support the identification of risk thresholds. The contextual framing of risk, including the approach taken to identify risk (top-down or bottom-up) and treatment of uncertain parameters, were found to be fundamental characteristics that influenced the methodology selected to evaluate adaptation options. The small sample of case studies available suggests that long-term coastal adaptation in Australian is in its infancy and there is a timely opportunity to guide local government towards robust methodologies for developing long-term coastal adaptation plans.

This trend is expected to continue in the future with climate change intensification. The main objectives of disaster risk management practices in all countries and communities are recognizing the mentioned patterns, building community resilience to reduce human and economic losses, and facilitating rapid recovery. Resilience assessment can inform these processes by, among other things, determining baseline performance and revealing priority intervention areas. This study aimed to assess the resilience of the provinces of Iran, as a country exposed to various types of disasters, based on the widely used Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities framework. The adapted framework included 35 indicators with five dimensions of social, economic, community capital, infrastructure and housing, and environment. For each of the 31 provinces, the overall and dimension-specific resilience scores were calculated. The results showed significant differences in community disaster resilience between the provinces. Overall, southern provinces that are close to the desert and characterized by hot and arid climates were relatively less resilient than other provinces. In contrast, northern provinces, especially those adjacent to the Caspian Sea had relatively higher resilience than others. Unexpectedly, we observed the low resilience of Tehran, the capital province, and its neighboring province, Alborz. Our results can inform planners and policymakers of the baseline performance of different provinces and facilitate evidence-based decision-making towards appropriate interventions and policies for enhancing resilience to climate change and other stressors. In addition to Iran, the results of this investigation provide useful insights for evolving resilience assessment frameworks in other developing countries.","[Javadpoor, Masoud; Roosta, Maryam] Shiraz Univ, Sch Art & Architecture, Shiraz, Iran; [Sharifi, Ayyoob] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci & Network Educ &, Higashihiroshima, Japan",Shiraz University; Hiroshima University,"Javadpoor, M (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Bldg 9 Dey,POB 7194685800, Shiraz, Iran.;Sharifi, A (corresponding author), 1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398530, Japan.",masoudjavadpoor71@gmail.com; sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp; m-roosta@shirazu.ac.ir,"Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013; Roosta, Maryam/HDM-0425-2022","Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613; Roosta, Maryam/0000-0001-9574-8166; javadpoor, masoud/0000-0003-1739-7975",,,,,89,8,8,9,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

Thus, we assessed in situ whether warming decreases the freezing resistance of Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, and we compared the level and mechanism of freezing resistance of these species in the field with previous reports conducted in lab conditions. We assessed the freezing resistance of C. quitensis and D. antarctica by determining their low temperature damage (LT50), ice nucleation temperature (NT) and freezing point (FP) in three sites of the King George Island. Plants were exposed during two growing seasons to a passive increase in the air temperature (+W). +W increased by 1K the mean air temperatures, but had smaller effects on freezing temperatures. Leaf temperature of both species was on average 1.7K warmer inside +W. Overall, warming decreased the freezing resistance of Antarctic species. The LT50 increased on average 2K for C. quitensis and 2.8K for D. antarctica. In contrast, NT and FP decreased on average c. 1K in leaves of warmed plants of both species. Our results showed an averaged LT50 of 15.3 degrees C for C. quitensis, and of -22.8 degrees C for D. antarctica, with freezing tolerance being the freezing resistance mechanism for both species. These results were partially consistent with previous reports, and likely explanations for such discrepancies were related with methodological differences among studies. Our work is the first study reporting the level and mechanisms of freezing resistance of Antarctic vascular plants measured in situ, and we demonstrated that although both plant species exhibited a great ability to cope with freezing temperatures during the growing season, their vulnerability to suffer freezing damage under a warming scenario increase although the magnitude of this response varied across sites and species. Hence, freezing damage should be considered when predicting changes in plant responses of C. quitensis and D. antarctica under future climate conditions of the Antarctic Peninsula.","[Sierra-Almeida, Angela; Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile; [Sierra-Almeida, Angela; Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile; [Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Agron & Recursos Nat, Fac Ciencias Agr & Forestales, Temuco, Chile; [Bravo, Leon A.] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Plant Soil Interact & Nat Resources Biotechno, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus, Temuco, Chile",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera,"Sierra-Almeida, A (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile.;Sierra-Almeida, A (corresponding author), Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile.",angelasierra@udec.cl,"Bravo, León/AAO-8437-2020; Sierra-Almeida, Angela/F-8409-2014","Bravo, León/0000-0003-4705-4842; Sierra-Almeida, Angela/0000-0002-4207-0950","PIA-Conicyt [ART-1102]; MINECOM F ICM [P02-005]; CONICYT under the IEB [PFB-23]; Fondecyt [11150710, 1151173]; NEXER-UFRO",PIA-Conicyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); MINECOM F ICM; CONICYT under the IEB; Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); NEXER-UFRO,"This work was supported by PIA-Conicyt under grant ART-1102; MINECOM F ICM under grant P02-005; and CONICYT under PFB-23 supporting the IEB, and Fondecyt 11150710 (AS-A) 1151173 and NEXER-UFRO (LB).",,75,14,14,0,21,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has a great bioenergy potential worth exploring in this context. This paper explores the state-of-art of bioenergy systems and synergies with eco-systems services in the BSR region in the context of developing the region's bio-economy. In this brief assessment, we consider 8 countries (i.e. Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark, and Belarus) in the region. While the production and use of modern bioenergy can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, promote energy security, diversify energy resources, and contribute to a successful circular economy and rural development, it is important to find a balance between the exploration of resources and the management of eco-systems services. In addition, both climate change vulnerability and bioenergy production may affect the environment and the capacity of the BSR to deliver ecosystem services (ESS). We recommend integrated strategies for optimal use of bioresources in the region. Bioeconomy can be realized by innovative approaches, establishing cross-cutting institutional and policy linkages for increased prosperity and green growth in the Baltic Sea Region.

Yet, wood formation is generally modelled with photosynthesis, despite mounting evidence that cambial activity is rather directly constrained by limiting environmental factors. Here, we apply a state-of-the-art turgor-driven growth model to simulate 4 yr of hourly stem radial increment fromPicea abies(L.) Karst. andLarix deciduaMill. growing along an elevational gradient. For the first time, wood formation observations were used to validate weekly to annual stem radial increment simulations, while environmental measurements were used to assess the climatic constraints on turgor-driven growth. Model simulations matched the observed timing and dynamics of wood formation. Using the detailed model outputs, we identified a strict environmental regulation on stem growth (air temperature > 2 degrees C and soil water potential > -0.6 MPa). Warmer and drier summers reduced the growth rate as a result of turgor limitation despite warmer temperatures being favourable for cambial activity. These findings suggest that turgor is a central driver of the forest carbon sink and should be considered in next-generation vegetation models, particularly in the context of global warming and increasing frequency of droughts.","[Peters, Richard L.; Cuny, Henri E.; Frank, David C.; Schaub, Marcus; Fonti, Patrick] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Forest Dynam, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Peters, Richard L.] Basel Univ, Dept Environm Sci Bot, Schonbeinst 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Peters, Richard L.; Steppe, Kathy; De Pauw, Dirk J.

The content of this review includes technologies - all the way from the laboratory studies to the industrial applications - their current status, and future potential. CCS is included for a comparison concerning the costs. Also, aspects as the CO2 impurities and the effect of it as well as various requirements concerning the CO2 impurity are included. Many recent studies show that CCU, especially CO2 conversion to fuels, will play an essential role in mitigating CO2 emissions, while developed methods and technologies are not yet mature. More research work needs to be conducted to improve the process efficiency via developing catalysts and reducing the cost of producing H-2 that is used as a reactant for fuel synthesis. Moreover, current literature also shows that impurities will affect the process of both CCS and CCU, while the work of studying their influence, especially on CCU, is still scarce. The cost of CCS has been estimated combined with impurities, while studies on cost estimation for CCU are still limited, and the cost, in general, is relatively high with the currently available technologies.","[Wang, Honglin; Laaksonen, Aatto; Yang, Zhuhong; Lu, Xiaohua] Nanjing Tech Univ, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanrong; Laaksonen, Aatto; Krook-Riekkola, Anna; Ji, Xiaoyan] Lulea Univ Technol, Div Energy Sci, Energy Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Laaksonen, Aatto] Petru Poni Inst Macromol Chem, Ctr Adv Res Bionanoconjugates & Biopolymers, Aleea Grigore Ghica Voda 41A, Iasi 700487, Romania; [Laaksonen, Aatto] Stockholm Univ, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, Arrhenius Lab, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Nanjing Tech University; Lulea University of Technology; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Petru Poni Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry; Stockholm University,"Lu, XH (corresponding author), Nanjing Tech Univ, State Key Lab Mat Oriented Chem Engn, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.;Ji, XY (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Div Energy Sci, Energy Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",xhlu@njtech.edu.cn; xiaoyan.ji@ltu.se,"Laaksonen, Aatto/G-7904-2012","Laaksonen, Aatto/0000-0001-9783-4535","Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao Young Scholars [21729601]; Swedish Energy Agency [P44678-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21776123]; Swedish Science Council [2019-03865]; Ministry of Research and Innovation of Romania (CNCS - UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III) [PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0050]; Carl Tryggers Stiftelse [18:175]","Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao Young Scholars; Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Swedish Science Council; Ministry of Research and Innovation of Romania (CNCS - UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III)(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); Carl Tryggers Stiftelse","This work was supported by the Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao Young Scholars (No. 21729601) and the Swedish Energy Agency (P44678-1).

The discipline is also expanding into previously unstudied regions, such as Australia, New Zealand, and northern Asia. Along with the new study regions, new schools of thought are also forming in the discipline, challenging old research paradigms. This is a necessary step forward for the discipline, as it grows and develops in the 21st Century. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is an ideal region to examine the dynamics of the climate and the hydrological system. This study investigated the annual precipitation, air temperature, and river discharge variability at five selected stations of the sub-basin by using Mann-Kendall (MK), Innovative trend analysis method (ITAM), and Sen's slope estimator test. The result showed that the trend of annual precipitation was slightly increasing in Ulaanbaatar (Z = 0.71), Erdenet (Z = 0.13), and Tsetserleg (Z = 0.26) stations. Whereas Murun (Z = 2.45) and Sukhbaatar (Z = 1.06) stations showed a significant increasing trend. And also, the trend of annual air temperature in Ulaanbaatar (Z = 5.88), Erdenet (Z = 3.87), Tsetserleg (Z = 4.38), Murun (Z = 4.77), and Sukhbaatar (Z = 2.85) was sharply increased. The average air temperature has significantly increased by 1.4 degrees C in the past 38 years. This is very high in the semi-arid zone of central Asia. The river discharge showed a significantly decreasing trend during the study period years. It has been apparent since 1995. The findings of this paper could help researchers to understand the annual variability of precipitation, air temperature, and river discharge over the study region and, therefore, become a foundation for further studies.","[Dorjsuren, Batsuren; Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao; Girma, Abel; Gedefaw, Mohammed; Abiyu, Asaminew] Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Dorjsuren, Batsuren; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Environm & Forest Engn, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Yan, Denghua; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, Water Resources Dept, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Enkhbold, Altanbold] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Art & Sci, Dept Geog, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia; [Xu Yiran] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Resources & Earth Sci, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Girma, Abel; Gedefaw, Mohammed] Univ Gondar, Dept Nat Resource Management, Gondar 196, Ethiopia",Donghua University; National University of Mongolia; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; National University of Mongolia; China University of Mining & Technology; University of Gondar,"Yan, DH (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.;Yan, DH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res IWHR, Water Resources Dept, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",Batsuren@seas.num.edu.mn; Yandh@iwhr.com; Wanghao@iwhr.com; ch_sonomdagva@num.edu.mn; altanbold@num.edu.mn; hsuijan@163.com; Abelethiopia@yahoo.com; Mohammedgedefaw@gmail.com; Asaminewab@yahoo.com,"Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/AFV-4937-2022; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/AAK-8941-2021; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/Q-6986-2018; Purevsuren, Tseveg/O-6645-2019; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/GQY-9193-2022","Cherinet, Asaminew Abiyu/0000-0002-2412-1507; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/0000-0003-2724-9263; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/0000-0002-7864-8291; Chonokhuu, Sonomdagva/0000-0003-2724-9263; Gedefaw, Mohammed/0000-0003-1985-7023; Girma, Abel/0000-0002-3460-6284","China, National Key Research and Development Project [2016YFA0601503]","China, National Key Research and Development Project","This research was funded by The China, National Key Research and Development Project (grant No. 2016YFA0601503).",,40,20,21,3,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2018,10,,,,,,1436,10.3390/w10101436,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10101436,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HB6UP,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,12/21/22,WOS:000451208400151,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modelling of LIDAR measurements appears useful approach for evaluating the effects of various environmental variables and scenarios as well as of different measurement geometries and instrumental characteristics. In this regard a Monte Carlo simulation model can provide a reliable answer to these important requirements. A semianalytic Monte Carlo code for modelling LIDAR measurements has been developed at ISAC-CNR. The backscattered laser signal detected by the LIDAR system is calculated in the code taking into account the contributions due to the main atmospheric molecular constituents and aerosol particles through processes of single and multiple scattering. The contributions by molecular absorption, ground and clouds reflection are evaluated too. The code can perform simulations of both monostatic and bistatic LIDAR systems. To enhance the efficiency of the Monte Carlo simulation, analytical estimates and expected value calculations are performed. Artificial devices (such as forced collision, local forced collision, splitting and russian roulette) are moreover foreseen by the code, which can enable the user to drastically reduce the variance of the calculation.","[Palazzi, Elisa; Kostadinov, Ivan; Petritoli, Andrea; Ravegnani, Fabrizio; Bortoli, Daniele; Masieri, Samuele; Premuda, Margherita; Giovanelli, Giorgio] Inst Atmspher Sci & Climate, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",,"Palazzi, E (corresponding author), Inst Atmspher Sci & Climate, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",,"Premuda, Margherita/B-1066-2013; Ravegnani, Fabrizio/A-7800-2009; Ravegnani, Fabrizio/AAM-5467-2021; palazzi, elisa/C-7048-2015; Bortoli, Daniele/A-5489-2009","Premuda, Margherita/0000-0003-4920-2861; Ravegnani, Fabrizio/0000-0003-0735-9297; Ravegnani, Fabrizio/0000-0003-0735-9297; palazzi, elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; Bortoli, Daniele/0000-0002-2334-4055",,,,,18,0,0,1,5,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,978-0-8194-6903-8,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,2007,,,,,G7451,G7451,,10.1117/12.737254,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.737254,,,12,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Remote Sensing,BHK54,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000253868600038,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a wide review of methodologies for constructing IDF curves with a specific focus on the choice of the dataset type, highlighting the main characteristics, possible uncertainties, and benefits that can be derived from their application. A number of studies based on updating IDFs in relation to climate change are analyzed. The research was based on a comprehensive analysis of more than 100 scientific papers and reports, of which 80 were found to be suitable for the aim of this study. To classify the articles, the key was mainly intensity-duration-frequency curves in relation to the types of datasets most used for their construction, specific attention was paid to the case study area. The paper aims to answer the following research questions. (i) What is the contribution of a data-rich era? (ii) Are remotely sensed data reliable to build IDFs in ungauged or partially gauged watersheds? (ii) How is uncertainty dealt with when developing IDFs? Remotely sensed data appear to be an alternative to rain-gauge data in scarcely gauged or ungauged areas; however, rain-gauge data are still a preferred dataset in the development of IDFs. The main aim of the present work is to provide an overview of the state of the art on the use of different types of data to build IDFs.

Crop growth control is done through sufficient management of environmental climatic variables as well as the quantity and quality of water and applied fertilisers with irrigation. Numerous crops such as cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, lettuces, strawberries, flowers, and herbs can be grown under greenhouse conditions using desalinated water.

Policymakers have been keener on developing policies and recommending best management practices from a life cycle perspective. This paper reviews the key LCA studies of the sheep sector within the last fifteen years to assess the state of the art of the environmental impacts of the sheep supply chain. Peer-reviewed LCAs as well as global, organizational efforts on the subject have also been reviewed and discussed. Discussions are categorized by products, hotspots, methodologies and system boundaries, and impacts of interest. The vast majority of studies have utilized a cradle-to-farmgate system boundary, where impacts associated with production of major farm inputs, management/applications of inputs and direct emissions from livestock are included. The sole focus of the majority of studies in terms of the category of impact has been climate change, quantified through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The impact results are difficult to generalize due to wide discrepancies in farming practices, production efficiencies, product allocation and emission modeling methods. The GHG emissions, however, associated with sheep meat, milk and wool fall in the range of 3.5-25 kg CO2-eq/kg live weight, 2-5 kg CO2-eq/kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), and 20-60 kg CO2-eq/kg greasy wool, respectively. The overwhelming consensus is that the single largest contributor to GHG emissions is direct methanic emission from livestock, generally contributing to 50%-75% of overall GHG emissions. More research needs to be conducted on determining impacts of post-farm activities such as processing of sheep products before it reaches the consumers, inclusion of the benefits of carbon sequestration, and consideration of environmental impacts other than climate change.

Therefore, understanding the resilience of agent-based complex systems such as ecosystems, i.e. their ability to absorb these pressures and sustain their functioning and services, is a major challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying resilience are still poorly understood. A main reason for this is the multidimensionality of both resilience, embracing the three fundamental stability properties recovery, resistance and persistence, and of the specific situations for which stability properties can be assessed. Agent-based models (ABM) complement empirical research which is, for logistic reasons, limited in coping with these multiple dimensions. Besides their ability to integrate multidimensionality through extensive manipulation in a fully controlled system, ABMs can capture the emergence of system resilience from individual interactions and feedbacks across different levels of organization. To assess the extent to which this potential of ABMs has already been exploited, we reviewed the state of the art in exploring resilience and its multidimensionality in ecological and socio-ecological systems with ABMs. We found that the potential of ABMs is not utilized in most models, as they typically focus on a single dimension of resilience by using variability as a proxy for persistence, and are limited to one reference state, disturbance type and scale. Moreover, only few studies explicitly test the ability of different mechanisms to support resilience. To overcome these limitations, we recommend to simultaneously assess multiple stability properties for different situations and under consideration of the mechanisms that are hypothesised to render a system resilient. This will help us to better exploit the potential of ABMs to understand and quantify resilience mechanisms, and hence support solving real-world problems related to the resilience of agent-based complex systems.","[Egli, Lukas; Grimm, Volker] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Weise, Hanna] Free Univ Berlin, Biodivers Ecol Modelling Res Grp, Altensteinstr 34, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Radchuk, Viktoriia] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res IZW, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, Berlin, Germany; [Seppelt, Ralf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Grimm, Volker] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Biodivers Synth, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Grimm, Volker] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Maulbeerallee 2, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Free University of Berlin; Leibniz Institut fur Zoo und Wildtierforschung; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Potsdam,"Egli, L (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",lukas.egli@ufz.de; hanna.weise@fu-berlin.de; radchuk@izw-berlin.de; ralf.seppelt@ufz.de; volker.grimm@ufz.de,"Radchuk, Viktoriia/C-6665-2013; Seppelt, Ralf/E-6056-2010","Seppelt, Ralf/0000-0002-2723-7150; Radchuk, Viktoriia/0000-0003-3072-0095; Weise, Hanna/0000-0003-3159-6735; Egli, Lukas/0000-0001-7617-3272",Helmholtz Association (Research School ESCALATE) [VH-KO-613]; German Research Foundation DFG [TI 824/2-1],Helmholtz Association (Research School ESCALATE); German Research Foundation DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"LE acknowledges funding from the Helmholtz Association (Research School ESCALATE, VH-KO-613).

Moreover, the lack of sufficient attention to the application of effective heat mitigation strategies in current urban development in these cities can drastically intensify the eventual impacts of UHI. Therefore, many governmental sectors and policy makers have been implementing operative solutions for cooling cities. Nevertheless, this study argues that in Kuala Lumpur, despite the growing attention to this matter, there is still a need for more rigorous consideration by the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professionals as well as more scholarly studies to reflect sustainable solutions to the UHI effect. As a result, today, some of the dense urban areas in Kuala Lumpur are characterized with the use of thermally massive building materials, urban surfaces with low albedo, complex urban morphology, waste heat, and low density of vegetation. On the other hand, recent studies demonstrate that there has been a rapidly increasing interest in studies related to UHI in other East Asian regions such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Hence, this study develops a comparative analysis to provide a state-of-the-art review of the recent attempts towards mitigating the UHI effect in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Among several available UHI mitigation strategies, this study is limited to the analysis of the environmental impacts of urban vegetation (green roofs, green facades, vertical greeneries and green pavements). Findings reveal that in general, urban greening can significantly mitigate the UHI intensity, both directly and indirectly, resulting in the decrease of global air temperature and mean radiant temperature up to 4 degrees C and 4.5 degrees C respectively. Overall, the study develops new practical guidelines, discusses the public benefits and elaborates on the future directions of UHI studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The different types of clouds, currently known and present in our skies, can produce radioactive effects that impact the variation of atmospheric conditions, with consequent strong dominance over the earth's climate and weather. Therefore, identifying their main visual features becomes a crucial aspect. In this paper, the goal is to adopt pretrained deep neural networks-based architecture for clouds image description, and subsequently, classification. The approach is pyramidal. Proceeding from the bottom up, it partially extracts previous knowledge of deep neural networks related to original task and transfers it to the new task. The updated knowledge is integrated in a voting context to provide a classification prediction. The framework trains the neural models on unbalanced sets, a condition that makes the task even more complex, and combines the provided predictions through statistical measures. An experimental phase on different cloud image datasets is performed, and the results achieved show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to state-of-the-art competitors.","[Manzo, Mario] Univ Naples LOrientale, Informat Technol Serv, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Pellino, Simone] IS Mattei Aversa MIUR, Dept Appl Sci, I-81031 Rome, Italy",University of Naples L'Orientale,"Manzo, M (corresponding author), Univ Naples LOrientale, Informat Technol Serv, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",mmanzo@unior.it; simonepellino@gmail.com,,"MANZO, Mario/0000-0001-8727-9865",,,,,30,13,13,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-4990,,MACH LEARN KNOW EXTR,Mach.

In particular, it shows how he depicted villas and mosaics as some of the finest examples of British cultural achievement under Roman rule, in a period when Roman Britain was largely seen as a military province and cultural backwater, and when aristocratic tastes were predominantly cosmopolitan. He asserted a dramatic improvement from former barbarism and placed Britain firmly within a pan-European classical tradition. The publications also showcased British achievements in the recording of Roman remains and antiquities and in landscape painting, serving as an impressive statement of intellectual and artistic superiority. Samuel Lysons and his associates were working collaboratively to an international agenda, celebrating Britain's cultural leadership in Europe. Their efforts, most notably in the recording of Romano-British mosaics, have underpinned an exemplary tradition of mosaic scholarship in Britain, and merit far greater recognition.","Univ Leicester, Sch Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Scott, S (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Sch Archaeol & Ancient Hist, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",sas11@le.ac.uk,,,,,,,200,3,3,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1759-5134,1759-5142,,CLASS RECEPT J,Class.

In particular, results from a numerical simulation of the twentieth-century and twenty-first-century climates, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) twentieth-century run (20C3M) and A1B scenario protocols, respectively, have been analyzed. The numerical simulations have been performed using a state-of-the-art global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled general circulation model (CGCM) with relatively high-resolution (T159) in the atmosphere. The CGCM skill in reproducing a realistic TC climatology has been assessed by comparing the model results from the simulation of the twentieth century with available observations. The model simulates tropical cyclone-like vortices with many features similar to the observed TCs. Specifically, the simulated TCs exhibit realistic structure, geographical distribution, and interannual variability, indicating that the model is able to capture the basic mechanisms linking the TC activity with the large-scale circulation. The cooling of the surface ocean observed in correspondence of the TCs is well simulated by the model. TC activity is shown to significantly increase the poleward OHT out of the tropics and decrease the poleward OHT from the deep tropics on short time scales. This effect, investigated by looking at the 100 most intense Northern Hemisphere TCs, is strongly correlated with the TC-induced momentum flux at the ocean surface, where the winds associated with the TCs significantly weaken (strengthen) the trade winds in the 5 degrees-18 degrees N (18 degrees-30 degrees N) latitude belt. However, the induced perturbation does not impact the yearly averaged OHT. The frequency and intensity of the TCs appear to be substantially stationary through the entire 1950-2069 simulated period, as does the effect of the TCs on the OHT.","[Scoccimarro, Enrico; Gualdi, Silvio; Manzini, Elisa; Vichi, Marcello; Oddo, Paolo; Navarra, Antonio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Bologna, Italy; [Gualdi, Silvio; Bellucci, Alessio; Sanna, Antonella; Fogli, Pier Giuseppe; Manzini, Elisa; Vichi, Marcello; Navarra, Antonio] Ctr Euromediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climatici, Bologna, Italy",Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV),"Scoccimarro, E (corresponding author), CMCC, Via Aldo Moro 44, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",scoccimarro@bo.ingv.it,"Scoccimarro, Enrico/AAV-6281-2020; Fogli, Pier Giuseppe/E-9486-2015; oddo, paolo/AAX-8221-2021; Vichi, Marcello/B-8719-2008; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; sanna, antonella/AAK-2890-2021; Manzini, Elisa/H-5760-2011","Scoccimarro, Enrico/0000-0001-7987-4744; Fogli, Pier Giuseppe/0000-0001-7997-6273; Vichi, Marcello/0000-0002-0686-9634; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; oddo, paolo/0000-0003-4451-3898; BELLUCCI, Alessio/0000-0003-3766-1921; SANNA, Antonella/0000-0002-4950-0853",European Commission [036961]; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per i Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Centro Euro-Mediterraneo per i Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"The authors are grateful to Erich Roeckner for his helpful comments.

We have developed an air-relative-humidity-based two-source (ARTS) E model that simulates the surface energy balance, soil water balance, and environmental constraints on E. It uses remotely sensed leaf area index (L-ai) and surface meteorological data to estimate E by: 1) introducing a simple biophysical model for canopy conductance (G(c)), defined as a constant maximum stomatal conductance g(smax) of 12.2 mm s(-1) multiplied by air relative humidity (R-h) and L-ai (G(c) = g(srnax) x R-h X L-ai); 2) calculating canopy transpiration with the G(c)-based Penman-Monteith (PM) E model; 3) calculating soil evaporation from an air-relative-humidity-based model of evapotranspiration (Yan & Shugart, 2010); 4) calculating total E (E-0) as the sum of the canopy transpiration and soil evaporation, assuming the absence of soil water stress; and 5) correcting E-0 for soil water stress using a soil water balance model. This physiological ARTS E model requires no calibration. Evaluation against eddy covariance measurements at 19 flux sites, representing a wide variety of climate and vegetation types, indicates that daily estimated E had a root mean square error = 0.77 mm d(-1). bias = -0.14 mm d(-1), and coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.69. Global, monthly, 0.5 degrees-gridded ARTS E simulations from 1984 to 1998, which were forced using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Lai data, Climate Research Unit climate data, and surface radiation budget data, predicted a mean annual land E of 58.4 x 10(3) km(3). This falls within the range (58 x 10(3)-85 x 10(3) km(3)) estimated by the Second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2: Dirmeyer et al., 2006). The ARTS E spatial pattern agrees well with that of the global E estimated by GSWP-2. The global annual ARTS E increased by 15.5 mm per decade from 1984 to 1998, comparable to an increase of 9.9 mm per decade from the model tree ensemble approach (Jung et al., 2010). These comparisons confirm the effectivity of the ARTS E model to simulate the spatial. pattern and climate response of global E. This model is the first of its kind among remote-sensing-based PM E models to provide global land E estimation with consideration of the soil water balance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Typically, simulations from climate models are used to assess future risks, but it is largely unknown how well the current generation of models represents compound extremes. Here, we introduce a new metric that measures whether the tails of bivariate distributions show a similar dependence structure across different datasets. We analyse compound precipitation and wind extremes in reanalysis data and different high-resolution simulations for central Europe. A state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset (ERA5) is compared to simulations with a weather model (Weather Research and Forecasting - WRF) either driven by observation-based boundary conditions or a global circulation model (Community Earth System Model - CESM) under present-day and future conditions with strong greenhouse gas forcing (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 - RCP8.5). Over the historical period, the high-resolution WRF simulations capture precipitation and wind extremes as well as their response to orographic effects more realistically than ERA5. Thus, WRF simulations driven by observation-based boundary conditions are used as a benchmark for evaluating the dependence structure of wind and precipitation extremes. Overall, boundary conditions in WRF appear to be the key factor in explaining differences in the dependence behaviour between strong wind and heavy precipitation between simulations. In comparison, external forcings (RCP8.5) are of second order. Our approach offers new methodological tools to evaluate climate model simulations with respect to compound extremes.","[Zscheischler, Jakob; Martius, Olivia; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Zscheischler, Jakob; Raible, Christoph C.] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Zscheischler, Jakob] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany; [Naveau, Philippe] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Martius, Olivia] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Martius, Olivia] Univ Bern, Mobiliar Lab Nat Risks, Bern, Switzerland; [Engelke, Sebastian] Univ Geneva, Res Ctr Stat, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Geneva,"Zscheischler, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.;Zscheischler, J (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Sidlerstr 5, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Zscheischler, J (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany.",jakob.zscheischler@ufz.de; christoph.raible@climate.unibe.ch,"Zscheischler, Jakob/ABE-7324-2021; Raible, Christoph/M-8309-2016","Zscheischler, Jakob/0000-0001-6045-1629; Raible, Christoph/0000-0003-0176-0602","Swiss National Science Foundation [179876, 172745, 178751]; Helmholtz Initiative and Networking Fund (Young Investigator Group COMPOUNDX) [VH-NG1537]; European Cooperation in Science and Technology [CA17109]",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Helmholtz Initiative and Networking Fund (Young Investigator Group COMPOUNDX); European Cooperation in Science and Technology(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This research has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant nos. 179876, 172745, and 178751), the Helmholtz Initiative and Networking Fund (Young Investigator Group COMPOUNDX, grant agreement VH-NG1537), and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (grant no.

The proposed algorithm is tested upon 31 cloudy GPS RO profiles from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC). It is found that the retrieval temperature is warmer than NCEP-reanalysis in the upper levels of the cloud and colder near and below the cloud base. Dropsonde observations for Hurricane Rita confirm this characteristic feature of the NCEP temperature analysis within clouds. The cloud thickness and cloud-base height that are determined by the proposed criteria are validated qualitatively with IR and VIS satellite images.

A large inter-annual variability is superimposed on this negative trend. Previous studies have emphasised a significant warming effect associated with latent energy transport into the Arctic region, in particular due to an enhanced greenhouse effect associated with the convergence of the humidity transport over the Arctic. The atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic is mostly accomplished by waves such as Rossby waves and cyclones. Here we present a systematic study of the effect on Arctic sea ice of these atmospheric wave types. Through a regression analysis we investigate the coupling between transport anomalies of both latent and dry-static energy and sea-ice anomalies. From the state-of-the-art ERAS reanalysis product the latent and dry-static transport over the Arctic boundary (70 degrees N) is calculated. The transport is then split into transport by planetary and synoptic-scale waves using a Fourier decomposition. The results show that latent energy transport as compared to that of dry-static shows a much stronger potential to decrease sea ice concentration. However, taking into account that the variability of dry-static transport is of an order of magnitude larger than latent, the actual impact on the sea ice appears similar for the two components. In addition, the energy transport by planetary waves causes a strong decline of the sea ice concentration whereas the transport by synoptic-scale waves shows only little effect on the sea ice. The study emphasises the importance of the large-scale waves on the sea ice variability.","[Hofsteenge, Marte G.] Univ Otago, Sch Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Hofsteenge, Marte G.; Graversen, Rune G.; Rydsaa, Johanne H.; Rey, Zoe] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Phys & Technol, Tromso, Norway; [Graversen, Rune G.] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, Tromso, Norway",University of Otago; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Norwegian Meteorological Institute,"Hofsteenge, MG (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Sch Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand.;Hofsteenge, MG (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Phys & Technol, Tromso, Norway.",marte.hofsteenge@postgrad.otago.ac.nz,,"Hofsteenge, Marte/0000-0001-5369-5318","Norwegian e-infrastructure for research and education, UNINETT Sigma2 [NN9348K, NS9063K]; Research Council of Norway (NFR) under the project The role of the atmospheric energy transport in recent Arctic climate change [280727]","Norwegian e-infrastructure for research and education, UNINETT Sigma2; Research Council of Norway (NFR) under the project The role of the atmospheric energy transport in recent Arctic climate change","We thank the ERA5 development group for providing the publicly accessible data on the ECMWF server that was used in this study.

The results show that the multimodel ensemble mean (MME) simulation has good ability to model the interannual variability of the WNPSH, EAJ and EASR, although some discrepancy exists among the individual models. The MME simulation can also reasonably capture the observed relationship of the EASR with the WNPSH and the EAJ. Under the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5 scenarios, the interannual variability in WNPSH, EAJ and EASR is projected by the MME to increase in the 21st century. In addition, the WNPSH and EAJ would still be the dominant systems influencing the East Asian summer precipitation under global warming scenarios.

There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-development flow-regimes and water quality, with an increasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the environment, but enhances the liveability of the urban landscape. Once regarded only as a nuisance, stormwater is now increasingly regarded as a resource. Despite the advances, many important challenges in urban hydrology remain. Further research into the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban rainfall is required to improve short-term rainfall prediction. The performance of stormwater technologies in restoring the water balance and in removing emerging priority pollutants remain poorly quantified. All of these challenges are overlaid by the uncertainty of climate change, which imposes a requirement to ensure that stormwater management systems are adaptable and resilient to changes. Urban hydrology will play a critical role in addressing these challenges. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Fletcher, T.

The state-of-the-art on these constraints' limits to a specific region, state, or a context; thus, the knowledge is scattered and not forming a global perspective on how and why communities' engagement in urban development has been hindered. Having a sound understanding of the existing barriers and challenges to community inclusive decision-making process is paramount for finding solutions for transforming current practices towards equitable urban development. Accordingly, this comprehensive, structured literature review aims to consolidate literature of the current challenges and barriers to community-driven decision-making in urban development and of the potential solutions to overcome them. A structured literature review covering indexed publications from 2010 to 2020 was carried out to identify and classify barriers/challenges and solutions that exist at present. Following a systematic filtering process, a total of 63 out of 1324 research contributions have been considered for an in-depth analysis. The study found 48 barriers and challenges regarding the current context, available infrastructure for community engagement, and current decision-making processes. Of all, the lack of communities' knowledge and awareness, absence of meaningful community engagement, and ill-defined aims and purpose of community engagement were identified as the topmost constraints. By synthesising the current research, the study found that these barriers can potentially be overcome through attitude transformation and capacity building of both community and professionals, investment in community engagement, and changes to present stakeholder engagement processes and policies.","[Geekiyanage, Devindi; Fernando, Terrence; Keraminiyage, Kaushal] Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Maxwell Bldg,43 Crescent, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Geekiyanage, D (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Maxwell Bldg,43 Crescent, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England.",M.D.Hembageekiyanage@edu.salford.ac.uk; T.Fernando@salford.ac.uk; K.P.Keraminiyage@salford.ac.uk,"Geekiyanage, Devindi/AAH-7567-2021","Geekiyanage, Devindi/0000-0002-7892-8445; Keraminiyage, Kaushal/0000-0002-8884-3509",Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/T003219/1]; ESRC [ES/T003219/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Grant ES/T003219/1 entitled Technology Enhanced Stakeholder Collaboration for Supporting Risk-Sensitive Sustainable Urban Development.,,83,9,9,1,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

As a result of continuous global warming, the spatial and temporal dynamics of these circulation systems have changed. The impact of such changes on the flow of subtropical rivers in the Hindu-Kush mountains of South Asia has not yet been explored, especially near the junction of the Westerlies and the South Asian Monsoon. This study examined the effect of precipitation and temperature variations on flows in the Swat River basin, which is located at the convergence of the two circulations and is one of the main tributaries of the Indus River. The modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test was used to investigate the historical (1965-2018) patterns of precipitation, temperature and river flow, and the abrupt shifts in flow regimes were analyzed using the sequential Mann-Kendall (SMK) test. Based on the findings of the SMK test, precipitation and temperature series were classified into pre- and post-mutation periods. Results of the MMK test showed that the precipitation, temperature and flow of the basin were increasing significantly. SMK results demonstrated that the significant increase in river flows started after 1984. The average annual flow in the post-mutation period (1985-2018) increased by 33.70% per decade compared with the post-mutation period (1985-2018). In addition, during the post-mutation period, a strong connection between precipitation and streamflow dynamics was found. We can conclude that the increasing tendency of the annual average streamflow in the North Kush mountains is primarily attributable to the increased quantity of regional precipitation.","[Anjum, Muhammad Naveed] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Land & Water Conservat Engn, Rawalpindi, Pakistan; [Ghanim, Abdulnoor A.

Assessing the area's solar potential needs analyzed information about the dataset of the measured global solar radiation (GSR). Researchers recently detected the high potential of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods in successfully estimating the GSR. In this study, a novel hybrid AI-based tool consisting of a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) integrated with improved simulated annealing (ISA) is proposed to predict the GSR over the Ahvaz synoptic station located in the South-West of Iran. The potential of the proposed hybrid paradigm so-called LSSVM-ISA was evaluated by using multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), generalization regression neural network (GRNN), and multivariate linear regression with interactions (MLRI). For precise assessment of efficiency of the AI models, various statistical metrics and validation methods were used to assess the precision of the developed models. A comparison of the obtained results indicated that the LSSVM-ISA method performed better than the MARS, GRNN, and MLRI models. The achieved RMSE values of the MARS, GRNN, and MLRI models were decreased by 9%, 16%, and 30% using the LSSVM-ISA model. Finally, the results demonstrated that the LSSVM-ISA model could be successfully employed for accurately estimating GSR.","[Jamei, Mehdi] Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Fac Engn, Shohadaye Hoveizeh Campus Technol, Ahvaz, Iran; [Ahmadianfar, Iman] Behbahan Khatam Alanbia Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Behbahan, Iran; [Jamei, Mozhdeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Water Sci & Engn Dept, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Jamei, Mozhdeh] Khuzestan Water & Power Author, Ahvaz, Iran; [Karbasi, Masoud] Univ Zanjan, Fac Agr, Zanjan, Iran; [Heidari, Ali Asghar] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Chen, Huling] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China",Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz; Ferdowsi University Mashhad; University Zanjan; University of Tehran; Wenzhou University,"Jamei, M (corresponding author), Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Fac Engn, Shohadaye Hoveizeh Campus Technol, Ahvaz, Iran.",m.jamei@shhut.ac.ir,"Karbasi, Masoud/Y-8622-2018; Heidari, Ali Asghar/M-6255-2018; Jamei, mozhdeh/AAQ-2723-2021","Karbasi, Masoud/0000-0002-9012-8280; Heidari, Ali Asghar/0000-0001-6938-9948; ",,,,,69,3,3,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5444,,,EUR PHYS J PLUS,Eur.

However, state-of-the-art global and regional climate model simulations yield a broad inter-model range of intensity, duration and frequency of these extremes. Here, we present a modeling experiment using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to determine the influence of the land surface model (LSM) component on uncertainties associated with extreme events. First, we analyze land-atmosphere interactions within four simulations performed by the WRF model from 1980 to 2012 over North America, using three different LSMs. Results show LSM-dependent differences at regional scales in the frequency of occurrence of events when surface conditions are altered by atmospheric forcing or land processes. The inter-model range of extreme statistics across the WRF simulations is large, particularly for indices related to the intensity and duration of temperature and precipitation extremes. Our results show that the WRF simulation of the climatology of heat extremes can be 5 degrees C warmer and 6 d longer depending on the employed LSM component, and similarly for cold extremes and heavy precipitation events. Areas showing large uncertainty in WRF-simulated extreme events are also identified in a model ensemble from three different regional climate model (RCM) simulations participating in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project, revealing the implications of these results for other model ensembles. Thus, studies based on multi-model ensembles and reanalyses should include a variety of LSM configurations to account for the uncertainty arising from this model component or to test the performance of the selected LSM component before running the whole simulation. This study illustrates the importance of the LSM choice in climate simulations, supporting the development of new modeling studies using different LSM components to understand inter-model differences in simulating extreme temperature and precipitation events, which in turn will help to reduce uncertainties in climate model projections.","[Garcia-Garcia, Almudena; Jose Cuesta-Valero, Francisco; Beltrami, Hugo] St Francis Xavier Univ, Climate & Atmospher Sci Inst, Antigonish, NS, Canada; [Garcia-Garcia, Almudena; Jose Cuesta-Valero, Francisco] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Environm Sci Program, St John, NF, Canada; [Gonzalez-Rouco, Fidel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Phys Earth & Astrophys Dept, IGEO UCM CSIC, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Bustamante, Elena] Res Ctr Energy Environm & Technol CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain; [Finnis, Joel] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF, Canada","Saint Francis Xavier University - Canada; Memorial University Newfoundland; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO); Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas; Memorial University Newfoundland","Beltrami, H (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Climate & Atmospher Sci Inst, Antigonish, NS, Canada.",hugo@stfx.ca,"García-García, Almudena/AGW-0891-2022; Garcia-Bustamante, Elena/GWC-8046-2022; Cuesta-Valero, Francisco/AAA-6747-2020; González-Rouco, Jesús Fidel/B-1761-2012","Garcia-Bustamante, Elena/0000-0002-2677-0252; Cuesta-Valero, Francisco/0000-0003-1577-671X; González-Rouco, Jesús Fidel/0000-0001-7090-6797",Hugo Beltrami's grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC [DG 140576948]; Canada Research Chairs program [CRC 230687],Hugo Beltrami's grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs),This research has been supported by Hugo Beltrami's grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant no.

However, numerical studies of how projected geophysical changes in sea ice will realistically impact ship navigation are lacking. To address this deficiency, we analyze seven climate model projections of sea ice properties, assuming two different climate change scenarios [representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5] and two vessel classes, to assess future changes in peak season (September) Arctic shipping potential. By midcentury, changing sea ice conditions enable expanded September navigability for common open-water ships crossing the Arctic along the Northern Sea Route over the Russian Federation, robust new routes for moderately ice-strengthened (Polar Class 6) ships over the North Pole, and new routes through the Northwest Passage for both vessel classes. Although numerous other nonclimatic factors also limit Arctic shipping potential, these findings have important economic, strategic, environmental, and governance implications for the region.","[Smith, Laurence C.; Stephenson, Scott R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Smith, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",lsmith@geog.ucla.edu,"Smith, Laurence C./E-7785-2012","Smith, Laurence C./0000-0001-6866-5904",National Science Foundation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cryosphere Program,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cryosphere Program,"Constructive, helpful reviews by two anonymous readers are gratefully acknowledged.

Under tropical climate and for large and high-dense mega cities like Singapore the elevated temperature levels yield to higher energy consumption for cooling, reduced outdoor thermal comfort, and a lowered quality of urban living in general. While modeling and simulation of UHIs has been done successfully for the temperate zone and cities of either dominantly flat roof-scape (i.e. in Europe) or repetitive urban layout (in the U.S.), the same approach cannot be applied to Singapore. Three-dimensional cellular automata (3D-CA) are here proposed as means to model the manifold vertical features, which are not sufficiently taken into account with current state-of-the-art methods: the heterogeneous high-rise landscape and convection as a major heat rejection mechanism. As we demonstrate 3D-CA enable a new approach of UHI modeling where traditional urban microclimate models fail and computational fluid dynamics are not applicable due to the large scale.","[Berger, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Berger, Matthias] SEC, Future Cities Lab, Singapore, Singapore",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Berger, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Berger, M (corresponding author), SEC, Future Cities Lab, Singapore, Singapore.",mberger@arch.ethz.ch,,,,,,,31,2,2,2,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"Radarweg 29, PO Box 211, AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-0509,,,PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI,,,2016,,,,,2000,2007,,10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.520,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.520,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Mathematics,BQ2GK,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000579452200189,View Full Record in Web of Science

This disciplinary diversity has contributed a wide range of methodological techniques and approaches to sea-ice studies, complicating comparisons of the results and the development of conceptual and numerical models to describe the important biogeochemical processes occurring in sea ice. Almost all chemical elements, compounds, and biogeochemical processes relevant to Earth system science are measured in sea ice, with published methods available for determining biomass, pigments, net community production, primary production, bacterial activity, macronutrients, numerous natural and anthropogenic organic compounds, trace elements, reactive and inert gases, sulfur species, the carbon dioxide system parameters, stable isotopes, and water-ice-atmosphere fluxes of gases, liquids, and solids. For most of these measurements, multiple sampling and processing techniques are available, but to date there has been little intercomparison or intercalibration between methods. In addition, researchers collect different types of ancillary data and document their samples differently, further confounding comparisons between studies. These problems are compounded by the heterogeneity of sea ice, in which even adjacent cores can have dramatically different biogeochemical compositions. We recommend that, in future investigations, researchers design their programs based on nested sampling patterns, collect a core suite of ancillary measurements, and employ a standard approach for sample identification and documentation. In addition, intercalibration exercises are most critically needed for measurements of biomass, primary production, nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter (including exopolymers), the CO2 system, air-ice gas fluxes, and aerosol production. We also encourage the development of in situ probes robust enough for long-term deployment in sea ice, particularly for biological parameters, the CO2 system, and other gases.","[Miller, Lisa A.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, Sidney, BC, Canada; [Fripiat, Francois; Tison, Jean-Louis] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Glaciol, Brussels, Belgium; [Fripiat, Francois] Vrije Univ Brussel, Earth Sci Res Grp, Analyt Environm & Geochem, Brussels, Belgium; [Else, Brent G.

Such risks are expected to become worse given projected changes in climate, degradation of ecosystems, population growth and urbanisation. In this respect, nature-based solutions (NBSs) have emerged as effective means to respond to such challenges. A NBS is a term used for innovative solutions that are based on natural processes and ecosystems to solve different types of societal and environmental challenges. The present paper provides a critical review of the literature concerning NBSs for hydro-meteorological risk reduction and identifies current knowledge gaps and future research prospects. There has been a considerable growth of scientific publications on this topic, with a more significant rise taking place from 2007 onwards. Hence, the review process presented in this paper starts by sourcing 1608 articles from Scopus and 1431 articles from the Web of Science. The full analysis was performed on 146 articles. The analysis confirmed that numerous advancements in the area of NBSs have been achieved to date. These solutions have already proven to be valuable in providing sustainable, cost-effective, multi-purpose and flexible means for hydro-meteorological risk reduction. However, there are still many areas where further research and demonstration are needed in order to promote their upscal- ing and replication and to make them become mainstream solutions.","[Ruangpan, Laddaporn; Vojinovic, Zoran; McClain, Michael E.] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Delft, Netherlands; [Ruangpan, Laddaporn; McClain, Michael E.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Water Management, Delft, Netherlands; [Vojinovic, Zoran] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Di Sabatino, Silvana; Leo, Laura Sandra] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy; [Capobianco, Vittoria; Oen, Amy M.

We show that there will be more severe heatwaves (in terms of intensity, duration, and frequency) due to mean warming, with minor contributions from future temperature variability changes. While these changes come primarily from greenhouse gas increases, aerosol reductions contribute significantly over the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, per degree of global warming, aerosol reductions induce a significantly stronger response in heatwave metrics relative to greenhouse gas increases. The stronger response to aerosols is associated with aerosol-cloud interactions, which are still poorly understood and constrained in current climate models. This suggests that there may exist large uncertainties in future heatwave projections, highlighting the critical significance of reducing uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interactions for reliable projection of climate extremes and effective risk management. Plain Language Summary The past few years have seen record heatwaves worldwide, primarily driven by human activities. We used a state-of-the-art earth system model to investigate future changes in heatwave characteristics under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario and seek to separate the roles of projected changes in anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols. The model shows that there will be more severe heatwaves (in terms of intensity, duration, and frequency) primarily because of global warming, while the internal variability of the climate system does not change much by 2100 and hence has limited influences. Also, these changes are mainly associated with greenhouse gas increases. However, anthropogenic aerosol changes have important influences, through their effects on clouds and radiation, and produce larger impacts comparing to greenhouse gases per unit of warming. Effects of aerosols on clouds such as changes in cloudiness and other rapid adjustments (e.g., changes in vertical temperature profiles), however, are still poorly represented in present generation climate models, leading to large uncertainties in future heatwave projections. Therefore, we call the attention of the community to prioritize efforts into reducing uncertainties involved in aerosol-cloud interactions, in order to get reliable projections of future climate extremes, as well as effective strategies for climate risk management.","[Zhao, Alcide; Bollasina, Massimo A.; Stevenson, David S.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Zhao, A (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",alcide.zhao@ed.ac.uk,"ZHAO, Alcide/ABF-8937-2020","ZHAO, Alcide/0000-0002-8300-5872; Bollasina, Massimo/0000-0001-7509-7650",University of Edinburgh; China Scholarships Council; UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership China as part of the Newton Fund; NERC [NE/N003411/1],University of Edinburgh; China Scholarships Council; UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership China as part of the Newton Fund; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"A.

It is also becoming increasingly clear that fossil fuels impose a high price on society through local environmental pollution and Africa's particular vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, Africa has an excellent renewable energy potential and prices for renewable energy are reaching the price range of fossil fuels. Comparing results from state-of-the-art Integrated Assessment Models we find different options for achieving a sustainable energy supply in Africa. They have in common, however, that strong economic development is considered compatible with the 2 degrees C climate target. Taking both challenges and appropriate solutions into account, some models find that a complete switch to renewable energy in electricity production is possible in the medium term. The continental analysis identifies important synergy effects, in particular the exchange of electricity between neighbouring countries. The optimal energy mix varies considerably between African countries, but there is sufficient renewable energy for each country. The intermittency and higher capital intensity of renewable energy are important challenges, but proven solutions are available for them. In addition, we analyse the political economy of a sustainable energy transition in Africa.Key policy insights An almost complete shift towards renewable energy (RE) is considered feasible and affordable in Africa.By 2050, electricity generation could be sourced largely from solar, wind and hydro power.Prices for RE in Africa are now within the price range of fossil fuels, partly due to the excellent RE potential.The optimal energy mix varies strongly between countries, but RE is sufficiently available everywhere.Addressing intermittency is possible, but requires investments and cooperation on the grid.","[Schwerhoff, Gregor] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Sy, Mouhamadou] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Schwerhoff, G (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",schwerhoff@mcc-berlin.net,"Schwerhoff, Gregor/L-2365-2019","Schwerhoff, Gregor/0000-0003-3644-3447",,,,,128,14,14,2,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

This fact unveiled the potential usefulness of HTS methods in a wide range of fields such as fishery assessment and management, for which their application has been extensively discussed. As a consequence of the rapid development, sequencing costs have continuously declined, leading to a general claim that HTS methods are cost-efficient compared with traditional ones. Within this context, the underlying research objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of genomic techniques through a review of the state of the art (SoA) on three HTS methods: i) environmental DNA (eDNA); ii) epigenetics method for age determination through DNA methylation (DNAm), and; iii) close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) applied on marine ecosystems and fisheries and for stock assessment purposes. The SoA review of the literature on HTS methods was performed through the snow-balling systematic reviewing approach. The analysis has considered the set of processes and variables necessary to perform the stock assessment and compared the capacity of current and HTS methods for providing the required data. Research reveals that HTS methods constitute a promising tool for fishery research and, particularly, for improving scientific advice. Nevertheless, up to now, only one research, on a non-commercial species, has been conducted on the application of HTS methods for stock assessment purposes. Although some partial data are present in the literature, no systematic analysis on costs has been found. This paper suggests that the future research agenda should attempt to straddle both the scenarios for the transition process, considering complementary implementation and substitution possibilities and their cost-efficiency.

Scientists around the world are ambitious to find eco-friendly and cost-effective routes for resolving these problems. Biochar has emerged as an agent for environmental remediation and has proven to be the effective sorbent to inorganic and organic pollutants in water and soil. Endowed with unique attributes such as porous structure, larger specific surface area (SSA), abundant surface functional groups, better cation exchange capacity (CEC), strong adsorption capacity, high environmental stability, embedded minerals, and micronutrients, biochar is presented as a promising material for environmental management, reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, soil management, and soil fertility enhancement. Therefore, the current review covers the influence of key factors (pyrolysis temperature, retention time, gas flow rate, and reactor design) on the production yield and property of biochar. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the diverse application of biochar such as waste management, construction material, adsorptive removal of petroleum and oil from aqueous media, immobilization of contaminants, carbon sequestration, and their role in climate change mitigation, soil conditioner, along with opportunities and challenges. Finally, this review discusses the evaluation of biochar standardization by different international agencies and their economic perspective.","[Shrivastava, Anamika; Gupta, Ajay Kumar] Govt Bihar, Dept Environm Forest & Climate Change, Patna, India; [Shrivastava, Anamika] Amity Univ, Noida, India; [Bhujbal, Sachin Krushna; Ghosh, Pooja] Inst Minerals & Mat Technol, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India; [Biswas, Jayanta Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Rural Dev & Technol, New Delhi 110016, India; [Singh, Lal; Kumar, Manish] Univ Kalyani, Dept Ecol Studies & Int Ctr Ecol Engn, Kalyani 741235, West Bengal, India; [Kumar, Manish] CSIR Natl Environm Engn Res Inst CSIR NEERI, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India; [Pandey, Ashok] Indian Inst Toxicol Res, Ctr Innovat & Translat Res, CSIR, Lucknow 226001, India; [Pandey, Ashok] Univ Petr, Sch Engn, Energy Studies, Sustainabil Cluster, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttaranchal, India; [Sharma, Prabhakar] Ctr Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Lucknow 226029, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Sharma, Prabhakar] Nalanda Univ, Sch Ecol Environm Studies, Rajgir 803116, Bihar, India",Amity University Noida; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Institute of Minerals & Materials Technology (IMMT); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Kalyani University; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR); University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES),"Kumar, M (corresponding author), Univ Kalyani, Dept Ecol Studies & Int Ctr Ecol Engn, Kalyani 741235, West Bengal, India.;Kumar, M (corresponding author), CSIR Natl Environm Engn Res Inst CSIR NEERI, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India.;Sharma, P (corresponding author), Ctr Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Lucknow 226029, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Sharma, P (corresponding author), Nalanda Univ, Sch Ecol Environm Studies, Rajgir 803116, Bihar, India.",psharma@nalandauniv.edu.in; manishkumar.bt@gmail.com,"Kumar, Manish/I-6186-2019; Sharma, Prabhakar/C-2133-2009","Kumar, Manish/0000-0002-1444-5508; Sharma, Prabhakar/0000-0003-0894-0809",,,,,341,1,1,66,66,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

To improve simulations of extreme rainfall events, we analyzed the performance of different convection and microphysics parameterizations of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model at very high horizontal resolutions (12,4 and 1 km). Our study focused on the eastern Mediterranean climate change hot-spot. Five extreme rainfall events over Cyprus were identified from observations and were dynamically downscaled from the ERA-Interim (El) dataset with WRF. We applied an objective ranking scheme, using a 1-km gridded observational dataset over Cyprus and six different performance metrics, to investigate the skill of the WRF configurations. We evaluated the rainfall timing and amounts for the different resolutions, and discussed the observational uncertainty over the particular extreme events by comparing three gridded precipitation datasets (E-OBS, APHRODITE and CHIRPS). Simulations with WRF capture rainfall over the eastern Mediterranean reasonably well for three of the five selected extreme events. For these three cases, the WRF simulations improved the ERA-Interim data, which strongly underestimate the rainfall extremes over Cyprus. The best model performance is obtained for the January 1989 event, simulated with an average bias of 4% and a modified Nash-Sutcliff of 0.72 for the 5 member ensemble of the 1-km simulations. We found overall added value for the convection-permitting simulations, especially over regions of high-elevation. Interestingly, for some cases the intermediate 4-km nest was found to outperform the 1-km simulations for low-elevation coastal parts of Cyprus. Finally, we identified significant and inconsistent discrepancies between the three, state of the art, gridded precipitation datasets for the tested events, highlighting the observational uncertainty in the region.

Research assessment exercises in AHSS disciplines now place a greater emphasis on measuring performance in terms of quantitative research metrics (such as: bibliometrics, impact factors and/or citation indices), in an attempt to demonstrate greater accountability and value-for-money within this age of austerity. This practice has the potential to impact negatively on the quality and diversity of research, as well as on the independence and autonomy of those undertaking AHSS research in Ireland and elsewhere. This article critically reviews research assessment exercises, with particular reference to the assessment of educational research in Ireland. It examines issues in the assessment of research within the neoliberal agenda that is evident in Ireland, and elsewhere. For example, in other jurisdictions, the neoliberal drive for accountability has been accompanied by an increase in 'citation clubs', a malpractice involving a group of researchers consistently citing each other's work to increase their citation index. It also challenges the validity of utilising predominantly quantitative research metrics in light of the recent move towards the online publication of research, where the manipulation of meta-data (key words that describe the research) has the potential to unfairly increase the citation indices of those researchers with a better understanding of search optimisation techniques within online contexts. The discussion concludes by summarising some of the emerging and emergent anxieties in relation to assessing research performance within assessment exercises.","[Holland, Charlotte; Lorenzi, Francesca] Dublin City Univ, Sch Educ Studies, Collins Ave, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Hall, Tony] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Educ, Educ Technol, Galway, Ireland",Dublin City University; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Holland, C (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Sch Educ Studies, Collins Ave, Dublin 9, Ireland.",charlotte.holland@dcu.ie,,,,,,,24,4,5,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1478-2103,,,POLICY FUTURES EDUC,Policy Futures Educ.,NOV,2016,8,,SI,,1101,1116,,10.1177/1478210316664263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1478210316664263,,,16,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,EG7GV,,Green Submitted,,,12/21/22,WOS:000391215300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

These discrepancies are confusing for policy and it is thus important to have scientific clarity on the basis of the assessment outcomes. Such clear insights can enable harmonisation of the different assessments. This review explores current state of the art approaches and methodologies used in bioenergy assessments, and identifies key elements that are critical determinants of bioenergy potentials. We apply the lessons learnt from the review exercise to compare and harmonise a selected set of country based bioenergy potential studies, and provide recommendations for conducting more comprehensive assessments. Depending on scenario assumptions, the harmonised technical biomass potential estimates up to 2030 in the selected countries range from 5,2 to 27.3 EJ in China, 1.1 to 18.8 EJ in India, 2.0 to 10.9 EJ in Indonesia, 1.6 to 7.0 EJ in Mozambique and 9.3 to 23.5 EJ in the US. From the review, we observed that generally, current studies do not cover all the basic (sustainability) elements expected in an ideal bioenergy assessment and there are marked differences in the level of parametric detail and methodological transparency between studies. Land availability and suitability lack spatial detail and especially degraded and marginal lands are poorly evaluated. Competition for water resources is hardly taken into account and biomass yields are based mostly on crude ecological zoning criteria. A few studies take into account improvements in management of agricultural and forestry production systems, but the underlying assumptions are hardly discussed. Competition for biomass resources among the various applications is crudely analysed in most studies and key assumptions such as demographic dynamics, biodiversity protection criteria, etc. are not explicitly discussed. To facilitate more comprehensive bioenergy assessments, we recommend an integrated analytical framework that includes all the key factors, employs high resolution geo-referenced datasets and accounts for potential feedback effects.

Keeping the body core temperature in a narrow optimum range is the dominating physiological process. Thus, assessing thermal environments has been a major field in biometeorology for many decades, which is also reflected in the number of respective articles and their citations. In the early days of thermal assessments, simple indices only considering a few environmental parameters were used. The next step has been the development of heat budget models describing all relevant heat/energy fluxes to and from the human body. One of the first was PET, which has been presented in the most cited IJBM publication ever (1999). All of these models created by individual scientists have some shortcomings and confinements in their application. In order to overcome such restrictions and to bring the state of the art scientists of thermal modelling together a working group to define a universal thermal climate index (UTCI) has been founded, backed and driven by an own commission of the International Society of Biometeorology. This working group has developed a comprehensive open source tool to calculate UTCI for the assessment of outdoor thermal environments for biometeorological applications (see the IJBM special issue 56 (2012) on UTCI).","[Jendritzky, Gerd] Univ Freiburg, Environm Meteorol, Priv Laerchenweg 3, D-79183 Waldkirch, Germany; [Hoeppe, Peter] Munich Re, Koeniginstr 107, D-80802 Munich, Germany",University of Freiburg; Munich RE Group,"Jendritzky, G (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Environm Meteorol, Priv Laerchenweg 3, D-79183 Waldkirch, Germany.",gerd.jendritzky@meteo.uni-freiburg.de; PHoeppe@munichre.com,,,,,,,38,7,7,4,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0020-7128,1432-1254,,INT J BIOMETEOROL,Int.

These biases manifest themselves as the sea surface temperature (SST) in the SEP being too warm and the SST in the TNA being too cold. That is, as the cold SST biases appear in the TNA, the warm SST biases also occur in the SEP. This indicates that if climate models cannot succeed in simulating the TNA variability, they will also fail at least partially in the SEP. Our coupled model experiments show that the cold SST bias in the TNA results in a weakening of the Hadley-type circulation from the TNA to the SEP. This meridional circulation reduces the South Pacific subtropical anticyclone and the associated subsidence, which in turn leads to a reduction of low clouds, a weakening of the easterly trade wind, and thus an increase of the warm SST bias in the SEP.","[Zhang, Liping] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Zhang, Liping] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Wang, Chunzai; Lee, Sang-Ki] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Song, Zhenya] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Lee, Sang-Ki] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); State Oceanic Administration; University of Miami,"Zhang, LP (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",ocean.climate.ping@gmail.com,"Song, Zhenya/F-9819-2013; Wang, Chunzai/C-9712-2009; Zhang, Liping/L-6480-2015; Song, Zhenya/AAC-2044-2019; Lee, Sang-Ki/A-5703-2011","Song, Zhenya/0000-0002-8098-5529; Wang, Chunzai/0000-0002-7611-0308; Zhang, Liping/0000-0003-1122-8927; Song, Zhenya/0000-0002-8098-5529; Lee, Sang-Ki/0000-0002-4047-3545","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office; NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); National Science Foundation; National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950500, 2013CB430301]",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Program Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"The CMIP5 data for this paper are available through the Earth System Grid-Center for Enabling Technologies (ESG-CET), on the page http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/.

By constraining biases, the rainfall increase is 70% of the raw projection. The Afro-Asian summer monsoon (AfroASM) sustains billions of people living in many developing countries covering West Africa and Asia, vulnerable to climate change. Future increase in AfroASM precipitation has been projected by current state-of-the-art climate models, but large inter-model spread exists. Here we show that the projection spread is related to present-day interhemispheric thermal contrast (ITC). Based on 30 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we find models with a larger ITC trend during 1981-2014 tend to project a greater precipitation increase. Since most models overestimate present-day ITC trends, emergent constraint indicates precipitation increase in constrained projection is reduced to 70% of the raw projection, with the largest reduction in West Africa (49%). The land area experiencing significant increases of precipitation (runoff) is 57% (66%) of the raw projection. Smaller increases of precipitation will likely reduce flooding risk, while posing a challenge to future water resources management.","[Chen, Ziming; Zhou, Tianjun; Chen, Xiaolong; Zhang, Wenxia; Zhang, Lixia; Wu, Mingna; Zou, Liwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ziming; Zhou, Tianjun; Wu, Mingna] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianjun; Chen, Xiaolong; Zhang, Lixia] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Zhou, TJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhoutj@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"Zhang, Wenxia/L-8394-2015; ZHOU, Tianjun/C-3195-2012","Zhang, Wenxia/0000-0001-8614-8070; ZHOU, Tianjun/0000-0002-5829-7279; Chen, Xiaolong/0000-0003-4098-9952","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606501, 2020YFA0608904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41988101]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0608904), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41988101), and National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606501).

And how do the models' biases in climatology in turn affect prediction of seasonal anomalies? We address these questions based on analysis of 1-month lead retrospective predictions for 21 years of 1981-2001 made by 13 state-of-the-art coupled climate models and their multi-model ensemble (MME). The evaluation of the precipitation climatology is based on a newly designed metrics that consists of the annual mean, the solstitial mode and equinoctial asymmetric mode of the annual cycle, and the rainy season characteristics. We find that the 1-month lead seasonal prediction made by the 13-model ensemble has skills that are much higher than those in individual model ensemble predictions and approached to those in the ERA-40 and NCEP-2 reanalysis in terms of both the precipitation climatology and seasonal anomalies. We also demonstrate that the skill for individual coupled models in predicting seasonal precipitation anomalies is positively correlated with its performances on prediction of the annual mean and annual cycle of precipitation. In addition, the seasonal prediction skill for the tropical SST anomalies, which are the major predictability source of monsoon precipitation in the current coupled models, is closely link to the models' ability in simulating the SST mean state. Correction of the inherent bias in the mean state is critical for improving the long-lead seasonal prediction. Most individual coupled models reproduce realistically the long-term annual mean precipitation and the first annual cycle (solstitial mode), but they have difficulty in capturing the second annual (equinoctial asymmetric) mode faithfully, especially over the Indian Ocean (IO) and Western North Pacific (WNP) where the seasonal cycle in SST has significant biases. The coupled models replicate the monsoon rain domains very well except in the East Asian subtropical monsoon and the tropical WNP summer monsoon regions. The models also capture the gross features of the seasonal march of the rainy season including onset and withdraw of the Asian-Australian monsoon system over four major sub-domains, but striking deficiencies in the coupled model predictions are observed over the South China Sea and WNP region, where considerable biases exist in both the amplitude and phase of the annual cycle and the summer precipitation amount and its interannual variability are underestimated.","[Lee, June-Yi; Wang, Bin; Fu, X.] Univ Hawaii, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kang, I. -S.] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Shukla, J.] George Mason Univ, Arlington, VA USA; [Kumar, A.; Schemm, J.

Drought over Mexico is modulated by ocean-atmospheric variability in the Atlantic and Pacific, raising the possibility for long-range seasonal climate forecasting, which could help mediate the economic and social impacts of future dry spells. The instrumental record of Mexican climate is very limited before 1920, but tree-ring chronologies developed from old-growth forests in Mexico can provide an excellent proxy representation of the spatial pattern and intensity of past moisture regimes useful for the analysis of climate dynamics and climate impacts. The Mexican Drought Atlas (MXDA) has been developed from an extensive network of 252 climate sensitive tree-ring chronologies in and near Mexico. The MXDA reconstructions extend from 1400 CE-2012 and were calibrated with the instrumental summer WA) self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) on a 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude grid extending over land areas from 14 to 34 degrees N and 75-120 degrees W using Ensemble Point-by-Point Regression (EPPR) for the 1944-1984 period. The grid point reconstructions were validated for the period 1920-1943 against instrumental gridded scPDSI values based on the fewer weather station observations available during that interval. The MXDA provides a new spatial perspective on the historical impacts of moisture extremes over Mexico during the past 600-years, including the Aztec Drought of One Rabbit in 1454, the drought of El Ano de Hambre in 1785-1786, and the drought that preceded the Mexican Revolution of 1909-1910. The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most important ocean-atmospheric forcing of moisture variability detected with the MXDA. In fact, the reconstructions suggest that the strongest central equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) teleconnection to the soil moisture balance over North America may reside in northern Mexico. This ENSO signal has stronger and more time-stable correlations than computed for either the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The extended Multivariate ENSO Index is most highly correlated with reconstructed scPDSI over northern Mexico, where warm events favor moist conditions during the winter, spring, and early summer. This ENSO teleconnection to northern Mexico has been strong over the past 150 years, but it has been comparatively weak and non-stationary in the MXDA over central and southern Mexico where eastern tropical Pacific and Caribbean/tropical Atlantic SSTs seem to be more important. The ENSO teleconnection to northern Mexico is weaker in the available instrumental PDSI, but analyses based on the millennium climate simulations with the Community Earth System Model suggest that the moisture balance during the winter, spring, and early summer over northern Mexico may indeed be particularly sensitive to ENSO forcing. Nationwide drought is predicted to become more common with anthropogenic climate change, but the MXDA reconstructions indicate that intense All Mexico droughts have been rare over the past 600 years and their frequency does not appear to have increased substantially in recent decades.

Even though the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been closely linked with the loss of Arctic sea ice, the role of atmospheric aerosols in past and future Arctic climate change remains elusive. Using a state-of-the-art fully coupled climate model, the authors assess the equilibrium responses of the Arctic sea ice to the different aerosol emission scenarios and investigate the pathways by which aerosols impose their influence in the Arctic. These sensitivity experiments show that the impacts of aerosol pertur-bations on the pace of sea ice melt effectively modulate the ocean circulation and atmospheric feedbacks. Because of the contrasting evolutions of particulate pollution in the developed and developing countries since the 1970s, the opposite aerosol forcings from different midlatitude regions are nearly canceled out in the Arctic during the boreal summer, resulting in a muted aerosol effect on the recent sea ice changes. Consequently, the greenhouse forcing alone can largely explain the observed Arctic sea ice loss up to the present. In the next few decades, the projected alleviation of particulate pollution in the Northern Hemisphere can contribute up to 20% of the total Arctic sea ice loss and 0.7 degrees C surface warming over the Arctic. The authors' model simulations further show that aerosol microphysical effects on the Arctic clouds are the major component in the total aerosol radiative forcing over the Arctic. Compared to the aerosol-induced energy imbalance in lower latitudes outside the Arctic, the local radiative forcing by aerosol variations within the Arctic, due to either local emissions or long-range transports, is more efficient in determining the sea ice changes and Arctic climate change.","[Wang, Yuan; Yung, Yuk L.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wang, Yuan; Jiang, Jonathan H.; Su, Hui; Choi, Yong-Sang; Huang, Lei; Yung, Yuk L.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Choi, Yong-Sang] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Huang, Lei] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Guo, Jianping] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China",California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Ewha Womans University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.;Wang, Y (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",yuan.wang@caltech.edu,"Wang, Yuan/A-5816-2013; Guo, Jianping/A-2378-2019; Guo, Jianping/K-1497-2017; Yung, Yuk/AAM-4850-2021","Wang, Yuan/0000-0001-6657-8401; Guo, Jianping/0000-0001-8530-8976; Guo, Jianping/0000-0001-8530-8976; Yung, Yuk/0000-0002-4263-2562",NASA ROSES14-ACMAP project [NNH14ZDA001N-ACMAP]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) under Public Technology Program based on Environmental Policy [2017000160003]; NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences [1700727],NASA ROSES14-ACMAP project; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) under Public Technology Program based on Environmental Policy; NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences,"The authors appreciate the funding support by the NASA ROSES14-ACMAP project (NNH14ZDA001N-ACMAP).

This globally averaged oxygen decrease is -0.93 +/- 0.23 mu mol l(-1), which is equivalent to annual oxygen losses of -0.55 +/- 0.13 x 10(14) mol yr(-1) (100-1000 m). The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. Approximately 15% of global oxygen decrease can be explained by a warmer mixed-layer reducing the capacity of water to store oxygen, while the remainder is consistent with an overall decrease in the exchange between surface waters and the ocean interior. Here we suggest that this reduction in water mass renewal rates on a global scale is a consequence of increased stratification caused by warmer surface waters.

J,"Hektor, B; Backeus, S; Andersson, K",,,,"Hektor, Bo; Backeus, Sofia; Andersson, Kjell",,,Carbon balance for wood production from sustainably managed forests,BIOMASS & BIOENERGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forestry; Biomass; Bioenergy; Carbon neutrality; Climate neutrality; Default values,BIOENERGY; SEQUESTRATION; ENERGY,"This Short Communication Paper approaches the CO2 emissions from forest biomass produced in sustainable managed forests from aspects related to photosynthesis and variations in vitality and capability of CO2 uptake, depending on i.a. different rotation periods and management regimes. These aspects are ignored or diminished in most other analyses on the subject as those analyses typically are based on simplified rigidly structured models. This Short Communication Paper suggests application of more relevant methodologies closer to actual real conditions. Two CO2 issues are covered; the CO2 balance between growth and harvesting of biomass in sustainably managed forests, and combustion of woody biomass in comparison with fossil fuels with regard to CO2 emissions. The analysis of the first issue leads to the conclusion that biomass harvested from sustainably managed forests should be regarded as carbon neutral as the vitality and CO2 absorption is sustained and kept on the same (or better) level. Moreover, to transform old pristine forests to young vigorous forests would be an effective (long term) means of reducing atmospheric CO2. Regarding the second issue, we notice that some other authors of papers on bioenergy claim that biomass would not be climate neutral when used for energy as, for generation of a given energy amount, more fixed carbon is released from biomass than from fossil fuels. In our opinion, authors of these papers apply obsolete, too general or sometimes illogical default values. This Short Communication Paper suggests that emissions from combustion of forest biomass should be compared with emissions from coal as it is the most common and relevant fuel to replace. Also additional emissions from mining/harvesting, transport, leakage, etc. should be included both for biomass and for reference fuels like coal, gas, and oil. The comparison should also be based on state-of-the-art technology, which for biomass would mean i.a. flue-gas condensing and efficient fuel treatment. Under these conditions, typical biomass applications for energy would be both carbon neutral and climate neutral. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the fate of CA precipitation in the future remains highly uncertain, for example, the state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projected -3% to +42% and -27% to +63% precipitation changes in northern and central-southern CA, respectively, under the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario (SSP585). In this work, we applied the Pareto optimality concept and used observed teleconnection patterns (causal relationships between ocean regions and CA precipitation) to mechanistically constrain CMIP6 projected CA precipitations. We estimated that precipitation will robustly increase by 0.4-1.3 mm d(-1) (10-34%) over northern CA and increase by 0.1-0.5 mm d(-1) (7-32%) over central-southern CA by the end of the 21st century compared with present-day. Up to 71% of ESM projection uncertainties were reduced mainly due to the strong and consistent causal relationship between North American west coast sea level pressure and CA precipitation in both observations and CMIP6 models. Our results suggest that teleconnection patterns are powerful mechanistic constraints that can help explain and reduce uncertainties in ESM projections.","[Li, Fa; Zhu, Qing; Riley, William J.; Yuan, Kunxiaojia] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate Sci Dept, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Li, Fa; Yuan, Kunxiaojia; Wu, Huayi; Gui, Zhipeng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan, Peoples R China",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Wuhan University,"Zhu, Q (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate Sci Dept, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",qzhu@lbl.gov,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Gui, Zhipeng/I-1068-2019; Zhu, Qing/G-2433-2015","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Gui, Zhipeng/0000-0001-9467-9680; Zhu, Qing/0000-0003-2441-944X; Li, Fa/0000-0002-0625-5587","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy [DEAC02-05CH11231]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the US Department of Energy under contract no.

A critical factor that undermines the advancement of research in EDNs is that many EDN scientists are confronted with scientific isolation and lack of exposure to state-of-the-art research methodologies. One of the means to ameliorate this problem is to build south-south (i.e. EDN-EDN) and north-south (i.e. EDN-EAN, or economically advanced nations) research partnerships, which become more effective when they are based on collaborative projects where the participants share their respective expertise.

At present, the oldest surviving examples are the mainly geometric tattoos on the individual known as Otzi, dating to the late 4th millennium BCE, whose skin was preserved by the ice of the Tyrolean Alps. In the Egyptian Nile valley, the arid climate has also promoted extensive soft tissue preservation. Here we report on the tattoos found during the examination of two of the best preserved naturally mummified bodies from Egypt's Predynastic (c. 4000-3100 BCE) period, making them the earliest extant examples from the Nile Valley. Figural tattoos that mirror motifs found in Predynastic art were observed on the right arm of one male and the right arm and shoulder of one female, demonstrating conclusively that tattooing was practiced in prehistoric Egypt. These findings overturn the circumstantial evidence of the artistic record that previously suggested only females were tattooed for fertility or even erotic reasons. Radiocarbon testing and datable iconographic parallels for the motifs indicate that these tattooed individuals are nearly contemporaneous with the Iceman, positioning them amongst the bearers of some of the oldest preserved tattoos in the world. At over five thousand years of age, they push back the evidence for tattooing in Africa by a millennium and provide new insights into the range of potential uses of tattoos in pre-literate societies by both sexes, revealing new contexts for exploring the visual language of prehistoric times.

Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (similar to 4991 km(2)) and seagrasses (similar to 517 km(2)) in India; however, the salt marshes (290-1398 km(2)) have contradictions in estimates. The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as similar to 9.6 billion US $, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between 0.47 and 5.43 billion US $. The present study also identified the key research areas that require priority to minimize the uncertainties in blue carbon stock assessment to foster a robust ecosystem-based approach for climate change adaptation in the country. The study identified that less than half of the total mangrove habitats of India are yet to be sampled leaving a scope of substantial uncertainty in nationwide blue carbon estimates.

Based on the first outputs of the EUMETSAT post-EPS user consultation process initiated in 2005, mission requirements for potential post-EPS missions have been drafted. Expertise from a variety of communities was drawn upon in order to ascertain user needs expressed in terms of geophysical variables, for operational meteorology, climate monitoring, atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, and hydrology. Current trends in the evolution of these applications were considered in order to derive the necessary satellite products that will be required in the post-EPS era. The increasing complexity of models with regard to parameterisation and data assimilation, along with the trend towards coupled atmosphere, ocean and land models, generates new requirements, particularly in the domains of clouds and precipitation, trace gases and ocean/land surface products. Following the requirements definition, concept studies at instrument and system levels will shortly commence with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), together with industry and representatives of the user and science communities. Such studies, planned for completion by end of 2008, aim at defining and trading off possible mission and system concepts and will establish preliminary functional requirements for full or partial implementation of post-EPS mission requirements. Cost drivers and needs for critical research and development will also be identified.

The study focuses on the transient response of the West African monsoon (WAM) to a sudden change in regional anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions, including land surface feedbacks but without sea surface temperature (SST) feedbacks. The response occurs in two distinct phases: 1) fast adjustment of the atmosphere on a time scale of days to weeks (up to 3 weeks) through aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions with weak hydrological cycle changes and surface feedbacks and 2) adjustment of the atmosphere and land surface with significant local hydrological cycle changes and changes in atmospheric circulation (beyond 3 weeks). European emissions lead to an increase in shortwave (SW) scattering by increased sulfate burden, leading to a decrease in surface downward SW radiation that causes surface cooling over North Africa, a weakening of the Saharan heat low and WAM, and a decrease in Sahel precipitation. In contrast, Asian emissions lead to very little change in sulfate burden over North Africa, but they induce an adjustment of the Walker circulation, which leads again to a weakening of the WAM and a decrease in Sahel precipitation. The responses to European and Asian emissions during the second phase exhibit similar large-scale patterns of anomalous atmospheric circulation and hydrological variables, suggesting a preferred response. The results support the idea that sulfate aerosol emissions contributed to the observed decline in Sahel precipitation in the second half of the twentieth century.","[Dong, Buwen; Sutton, Rowan T.; Wilcox, Laura] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Highwood, Ellie] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Dong, B (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",b.dong@reading.ac.uk,"Wilcox, Laura J/F-3394-2013","Wilcox, Laura J/0000-0001-5691-1493; Dong, Buwen/0000-0003-0809-7911; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583","PA-GODA project of the Changing Water Cycle programme of UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I006672/1]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [607085]; U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; NERC [NE/I006672/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I006672/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish",PA-GODA project of the Changing Water Cycle programme of UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7); U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work is supported by PA-GODA project of the Changing Water Cycle programme of UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under Grant NE/I006672/1 and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement 607085.

In this study, we apply various validation metrics to comprehensively evaluate three latest model-based and satellite-based precipitation products, namely the fifth-generation global atmospheric analysis data set of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5), ERA5-Land and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Final Run (IMERG-Final), against hourly rain gauge observations over Jiangxi province, south central China, in 2019. The main conclusions of this study include but not limited to: (a) considering the precipitation amount, both reanalysis precipitation data and satellite-based precipitation products have similar spatial patterns and show overestimations; (b) IMERG-Final generally outperforms ERA5 and ERA5-Land at multiple temporal scales, especially in terms of CC, FAR and MFI; (c) ERA5 and ERA5-Land precipitation products have similar spatiotemporal error characteristics, and ERA5-Land performs better than ERA5; (d) in the respect of the capabilities of capturing precipitation events, the spatial characteristics of IMERG-Final are the closest to those of rain gauges, while ERA5 and ERA5-Land significantly overestimate the event duration and underestimate the mean event precipitation rate. These findings could help the state-of-the-art model-based and satellite-based precipitation products improve the data quality in the future generations.","[Hong, Tulin; Chen, Meiqiu] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Land Resources Environm, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Hong, Tulin; Chen, Meiqiu] Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Poyang Basin Agr Resources &, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Hong, Tulin] Land Consolidat & Rehabil Ctr Jiangxi, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongyi] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Land Resource Management, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, MQ (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Land Resources Environm, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.;Chen, MQ (corresponding author), Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Poyang Basin Agr Resources &, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",cmq12@jxau.edu.cn,,"Chen, Meiqiu/0000-0002-4921-3643",National Science Foundation of China [42071068]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20202BABL205025],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province),"This research is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation of China (No. 42071068), and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No 20202BABL205025).

The context is a medical facility case study (MFCS) in AD, which includes a landscape 50% as large as its building footprint. The project identified the need to investigate the impact of air handling unit (AHU) air conditioning (A/C) condensate water (CW) quality on soil health and building hydraulic systems. The aim of the research was to measure the impact of using recycled on-site NPW sources in a MFCS in AD, to alleviate the use of desalinated potable water and reduce associated energy consumption, operation cost, and greenhouse gas emissions for landscape irrigation (LI) and water feature (WF) use. CW has been tested in 2016 and in 2017 and analysed against local authority's parameter limits to establish suitability for LI and WF use. The findings are that in AD CW classification and characterization is a gap in knowledge whereby salinity and toxicity concentration limits should be addressed by the local authority because CW has an impact on soil infiltration rate due its low dissolved salt content as evidenced by the water test results. The recommendations for this paper are to develop a sustainable water conservation and reuse (SWC) strategy forming the basis for a water protocol by the competent authority for regional medical facility including a methodology for assessing on-site NPW quality for outdoor reuse to reduce soil infiltration problems and consequently conserve water and associated energy. The next steps are to confirm if the MFCS soil infiltration rate is affected by the CW or other factors, and to test additional NPW types.","[Seguela, Geraldine; Littlewood, J.

National meteorological and hydrological services and intergovernmental organizations, such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), provide routine operational forecasts on a range of spatio-temporal scales by running these models at high resolution on state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems. Such operational forecasts are very demanding in terms of computing resources. To facilitate the use of a weather forecast model for research and training purposes outside the operational environment, ECMWF provides a portable version of its numerical weather forecast model, OpenIFS, for use by universities and other research institutes on their own computing systems. In this paper, we describe a new project (OpenIFS@home) that combines OpenIFS with a citizen science approach to involve the general public in helping conduct scientific experiments. Volunteers from across the world can run OpenIFS@home on their computers at home, and the results of these simulations can be combined into large forecast ensembles. The infrastructure of such distributed computing experiments is based on our experience and expertise with the climateprediction.net (https://www.climateprediction.net/, last access: 1 June 2021) and weather@home systems. In order to validate this first use of OpenIFS in a volunteer computing framework, we present results from ensembles of forecast simulations of Tropical Cyclone Karl from September 2016 studied during the NAWDEX field campaign. This cyclone underwent extratropical transition and intensified in mid-latitudes to give rise to an intense jet streak near Scotland and heavy rainfall over Norway. For the validation we use a 2000-member ensemble of OpenIFS run on the OpenIFS@home volunteer framework and a smaller ensemble of the size of operational forecasts using ECMWF's forecast model in 2016 run on the ECMWF supercomputer with the same horizontal resolution as OpenIFS@home. We present ensemble statistics that illustrate the reliability and accuracy of the OpenIFS@home forecasts and discuss the use of large ensembles in the context of forecasting extreme events.","[Sparrow, Sarah; Bowery, Andrew; Wallom, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford E Res Ctr, Engn Sci, Oxford, England; [Carver, Glenn D.; Kohler, Marcus O.; Pappenberger, Florian; Weisheimer, Antje] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Reading, Berks, England; [Weisheimer, Antje] Univ Oxford, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci NCAS, Phys Dept, Oxford, England; [Ollinaho, Pirkka] Finnish Meteorol Inst FMI, Helsinki, Finland",University of Oxford; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Oxford; Finnish Meteorological Institute,"Sparrow, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford E Res Ctr, Engn Sci, Oxford, England.",sarah.sparrow@oerc.ox.ac.uk,"Sparrow, Sarah N/D-7905-2016; Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009; Kohler, Marcus/D-1481-2013","Sparrow, Sarah N/0000-0002-1802-6909; Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Weisheimer, Antje/0000-0002-7231-6974; Kohler, Marcus/0000-0002-8323-8684; Carver, Glenn/0000-0001-7582-6497; Wallom, David/0000-0001-7527-3407",,,,,74,5,5,1,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The soil moisture data from these models have been used for operational drought monitoring activities, but so far have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, three available in situ soil moisture observation data sets in the United States were used to evaluate the model-simulated soil moisture for different time scales varying from daily to annual. First, we used the observed multiple layer monthly and annual mean soil moisture from the Illinois Climate Network to evaluate 20-years (January 1985-December 2004) of model-simulated soil moisture in terms of skill and analysis of error statistics. Second, we utilized 6-years (1 January 1997-31 December 2002) of daily soil moisture observed from 72 sites over the Oklahoma Mesonet network to assess daily and monthly simulation skill and errors for 3 model soil layers (0-10 cm, 10-40 cm, 40-100 cm). Third, we extended the daily assessment to sites over the continental United States using 8-years (1 January 2002-31 December 2009) of observations for 121 sites from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Overall, all models are able to capture wet and dry events and show high skill (in most cases, anomaly correlation is larger than 0.7), but display large biases when compared to in situ observations. These errors may come from model errors (i.e., model structure error, model parameter error), forcing data errors, and in situ soil moisture measurement errors. For example, all models simulate less soil moisture due to lack of modeled irrigation and ground water processes in Illinois, Oklahoma, and the other Midwest states.

In this study, we investigate how the use of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), in the form of stratified water storage, could reduce the peak daily demand associated with GSHP systems and thus improve their cost effectiveness. This system was compared to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, to investigate the potential cost and emissions impacts of electrification on large energy users transitioning from high efficiency fossil fuel equipment. This study builds on previous research by using a significant campus area, and investi-gating the various impacts of an electrified system versus a state of the art fossil fuel system. An established method of TRNSYS modeling is used for the heat pumps and borehole heat exchangers (BHEs), along with the TES. The GSHP system with TES is modeled to follow industry standards and sized to provide an optimal balance of capital and operating costs. Costs were investigated for a unique large energy user rate structure, as well as for a more common generalized rate structure. The results show that the addition of TES to the GSHP system could reduce operating costs by 4.5%, but still incurs a 5.64% cost increase from the baseline CHP system. It is also shown, however, that a tactical integration of heat pumps into the CHP system is the most cost effective solution, only increasing the operating costs by 4.71%. Likewise, the impacts of different rate structures are highlighted, with the TES only resulting in 0.75% cost savings under the generalized utility rate. Furthermore, it is shown that thermal storage has great potential for demand reduction, with the addition of storage incurring a decrease of 7-22% in annual peak demand kW, dependent on the rate structure.","[Ryan, Erich; McDaniel, Benjamin; Kosanovic, Dragoljub] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Ryan, E (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",erichryan2015@gmail.com,,,US Department of Energy;  [DE-EE0007708],US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); ,Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by the US Department of Energy under grant DE-EE0007708.,,43,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

In contrast to simulation based on partial differential equations derived from first-principles modeling, ExaGeoStat employs a statistical model based on the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function, which operates on a large dense covariance matrix. Generated by the parametrizable Matern covariance function, the resulting matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The computational tasks involved during the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function become daunting as the number n of geographical locations grows, as O(n(2)) storage and O(n(3)) operations are required. While many approximation methods have been devised from the side of statistical modeling to ameliorate these polynomial complexities, we are interested here in the complementary approach of evaluating the exact algebraic result by exploiting advances in solution algorithms and many-core computer architectures. Using state-of-the-art high performance dense linear algebra libraries associated with various leading edge parallel architectures (Intel KNLs, NVIDIA GPUs, and distributed-memory systems), ExaGeoStat raises the game for statistical applications from climate and environmental science. ExaGeoStat provides a reference evaluation of statistical parameters, with which to assess the validity of the various approaches based on approximation. The software takes a first step in the merger of large-scale data analytics and extreme computing for geospatial statistical applications, to be followed by additional complexity reducing improvements from the solver side that can be implemented under the same interface. Thus, a single uncompromised statistical model can ultimately be executed in a wide variety of emerging exascale environments.","[Abdulah, Sameh; Ltaief, Hatem; Sun, Ying; Genton, Marc G.; Keyes, David E.] KAUST, Extreme Comp Res Ctr, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div CEMSE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Abdulah, S (corresponding author), KAUST, Extreme Comp Res Ctr, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn Div CEMSE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.",Sameh.Abdulah@kaust.edu.sa; Hatem.Lataief@kaust.edu.sa; ying.sun@kaust.edu.sa; marc.genton@kaust.edu.sa; david.keyes@kaust.edu.sa,"Abdulah, Sameh/AAI-5528-2021; Sun, Ying/N-2009-2017","Abdulah, Sameh/0000-0002-8850-5753; Sun, Ying/0000-0001-6703-4270; Keyes, David Elliot/0000-0002-4052-7224; Ltaief, Hatem/0000-0002-6897-1095; Genton, Marc Georges/0000-0001-6467-2998",King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); Intel; Cray,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); Intel(Intel Corporation); Cray,"The research reported in this publication was supported by funding from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

Changes in these components, as a response to rapidly warming climate in the Arctic, are intensely expressed in the coastal zone. These areas receive increased terrestrial runoff while subject to a changing sea-ice and ocean environment. Proxies derived from marine sediment archives provide long-term data that extend beyond instrumental measurements. They are therefore fundamental in disentangling human-driven versus natural processes, changes and responses. This paper (1) provides an overview of current Arctic cryosphere change, (2) reviews state-of-the-art palaeoecological approaches, (3) identifies methodological and knowledge gaps, and (4) discusses the strengths and future potential of palaeoecology and palaeoceanography to respond to societally relevant coastal marine ecosystem challenges. We utilise responses to an open survey conducted by the Future Earth Past Global Changes (PAGES) working group Arctic Cryosphere Change and Coastal Marine Ecosystems (ACME). Significant research advancements have taken place in recent decades, including the increasingly common use of multi-proxy (multiple lines of evidence) studies, improved understanding of species-environment relationships, and development of novel proxies. Significant gaps remain, however, in the understanding of proxy sources and behaviour, the use of quantitative techniques, and the availability of reference data from coastal environments. We highlight the need for critical methodological refinement, interdisciplinary collaboration on research approaches, and enhanced communication across the scientific community.","[Heikkila, Maija; Weckstrom, Kaarina] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Environm Change Res Unit, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Heikkila, Maija; Weckstrom, Kaarina] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Helsinki, Finland; [Ribeiro, Sofia; Weckstrom, Kaarina] Geol Survey Denmark & Greenland GEUS, Dept Glaciol & Climate, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Pienkowski, Anna J.] Univ Ctr Svalbard UNIS, Dept Arctic Geol, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway; [Pienkowski, Anna J.] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Geol, Makow Polnych 16, PL-61606 Poznan, Poland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Geological Survey Of Denmark & Greenland; University Centre Svalbard (UNIS); Adam Mickiewicz University,"Heikkila, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Environm Change Res Unit, Ecosyst & Environm Res Programme, POB 65, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",maija.heikkila@helsinki.fi,"Pieńkowski, Anna J./AAL-1312-2020; Ribeiro, Sofia/AAZ-2782-2021; Heikkila, Maija/N-7659-2013","Pieńkowski, Anna J./0000-0002-3606-7130; Ribeiro, Sofia/0000-0003-0672-9161; Heikkila, Maija/0000-0003-3885-8670; Weckstrom, Kaarina/0000-0002-3889-0788","Academy of Finland [1296895, 1308272, 1328540, 1334509]; Independent Research Fund of Denmark [9064-0039B]; Geocenter Denmark; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada [RGPIN-2016-05457]",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Independent Research Fund of Denmark; Geocenter Denmark; Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"The authors are grateful for the continuing support from the Past Global Changes International Project Office (PAGES-IPO) and the valuable contributions from the respondents to the open PAGES Arctic Cryosphere Change and Coastal Marine Ecosystems Working Group (http://pastglobalchanges.org/acme) community questionnaire.

Although research in art education over the past four decades has shown children's drawing and drawings to be rich sites of imaginative, sociocultural, performative, relational, and intra-active learning, encounters with drawing continue to be marginalized in elementary education settings as coloring, busy work, and/or copying. In an 8-month-long case study on children's drawing and drawings in a kindergarten writer's workshop, I focused on intra-actions involving material, discursive, and emergent events through which children, drawing, and discourses were mutually enacted. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to nuances in children's classroom drawing in order to cultivate dialog between art educators, early childhood educators, and language and literacy educators, among others.","[Penn, Leslie Rech] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Penn, LR (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",lkrech@uga.edu,,"Rech Penn, Leslie/0000-0002-0973-2393",,,,,55,2,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0039-3541,2325-8039,,STUD ART EDUC,Stud.

This research combines quantitative assessments of children's narrative comprehension, narrative production, vocabulary development, false-belief understanding, and imagination skills with a qualitative descriptive analysis of the implementation of a theatre-in-education program to investigate the effect of a respected preschool TIE program on the development of 155 urban children enrolled in Head Start. Although the measures used were unable to detect a significant effect of the drama intervention, in the current academic climate, in which an increasing focus on academics in preschool curricula can lead to the elimination of arts programming, it is worth noting that the inclusion of a TIE program did not detract from the children's acquisition of skills that contribute to school readiness; the scores on assessments of language, perspective-taking, and imagination were similar for children in the intervention and comparison conditions. Thus, this study suggests that the inclusion of high-quality theatre arts curricula in early childhood education can provide young children with an entertaining and engaging preschool drama experience while providing academic supports commensurate with those of more traditional early childhood programs.

This touristy area belongs to the city of Rostock in Germany. As response to sea level rise and heavy coastal erosion, the small seaside resort Markgrafenheide received a comprehensive storm surge protection until 2006. Subsequently, the adjacent Hutelmoor was flooded with the aim to restore it as a brackish coastal moor. Coastal protection measures at the Baltic Sea coastline were abandoned to enable natural dynamics, a coastal realignment and salt water intrusions. The entire process until full implementation took 14 years and was associated with very problematic public participation and a strong local polarization. Based on a literature and media review, two surveys, and expert interviews we retrospectively document and analyse the planning process with focus on public information, perception and participation. The local population and holidaymakers did not perceive coastal changes and if, did not associate them with climate change. Interviewees remembered single storm surges, but felt save from it and sea level rise was not perceived as a threat. 89% said that they feel insufficiently informed about the combined coastal protection wetland restoration measure, but did not use the offered information possibilities. 81% had their information from newspapers and freely distributed advertisers. It seems that insufficient information was the major reason for the problems with local acceptance and public participation. The media played a dominating role. The decline of traditional newspapers and the growths of free advertisers seemed to have a negative impact on quality of information and favoured a polarization. Additionally, we discuss local specifics like the cultural background (GDR history), traditions, frustration and the relatively old population and their role in public participation. We strongly promote a pro-active and long-term information and public relation strategy.","[Schernewski, Gerald; Schumacher, Johanna; Weisner, Eva; Donges, Larissa] Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Coastal Res & Management Grp, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Schernewski, Gerald] Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Herkus Mantas G 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania",Leibniz Institut fur Ostseeforschung Warnemunde; Klaipeda University,"Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Baltic Sea Res Warnemunde, Coastal Res & Management Grp, Seestr 15, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.;Schernewski, G (corresponding author), Klaipeda Univ, Marine Sci & Technol Ctr, Herkus Mantas G 84, LT-92294 Klaipeda, Lithuania.",gerald.schernewski@io-warnemuende.de,,"Schumacher, Johanna/0000-0003-4881-7776; Schernewski, Gerald/0000-0002-4036-7646","BONUS BaltCoast project; BONUS from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [185]; Baltic Sea national funding institutions","BONUS BaltCoast project; BONUS from the European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration; Baltic Sea national funding institutions","The work was part-funded by the BONUS BaltCoast project.

In conclusion, the derived damage curves and formulae were transferred to a unified design. Findings - Damage functions for the transport sector are scarce in the literature. Although specific damage functions for particular transport assets exist, they mainly consider infrastructure or transport in general. Occasionally, damage curves for the same asset in different publications vary. Major research gaps persist in wildfire damage estimation. Research limitations/implications - The study scope was restricted to the hazards of fluvial floods and wildfires. Despite all efforts, this study did not cover all existing literature on the topic.

Colonial and post-colonial political governance and economic models have broken down traditional mechanisms for coping with ecological stress. An archaeological example from the Chalbi Desert is presented as evidence of longue-duree persistence of human occupations through extreme climatic fluctuations. Occupations spanning from ca. 5000 to 600 years BP indicate the presence of robust regional exchange networks and either continuous or repeated occupation of this hot, dry, mosaic woodland. These systems are contrasted against the extrinsically imposed models that began in the late 1800s with the arrival of colonialism in which political economies are more focused on ethnic-territorial and global interests rather than regional cooperation. A long-term ecological model on how traditional systems evolved to cope with vulnerability associated with extreme climate conditions is needed to build resilient communities.","[Wright, David K.] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, Seoul, South Korea; [Wright, David K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Seoul National University (SNU); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Earth Environment, CAS","Wright, DK (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Archaeol & Art Hist, Seoul, South Korea.;Wright, DK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",msafiri@snu.ac.kr,"Wright, David K./H-3311-2019","Wright, David K./0000-0003-1704-0423",'Overseas Training Expenses for Humanities' through the College of Humanities Seoul National University (SNU); British Institute in Eastern Africa; United Nations' African Studies Institute at the University of Nairobi,'Overseas Training Expenses for Humanities' through the College of Humanities Seoul National University (SNU); British Institute in Eastern Africa; United Nations' African Studies Institute at the University of Nairobi,"Archival research on the North Horr collection was conducted with permission from the Office of the President of the Republic of Kenya (permit MOHEST 13/001/30C 220) and in collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya Department of Earth Sciences.

J,"Koh, W",,,,"Koh, Wilson",,,'I am Iron Man': the Marvel Cinematic Universe and celeactor labour,CELEBRITY STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,superheroes; celeactor; oneiric climate; blockbuster franchise,,"This article analyses why assertions of superheroic identity, textually privileged yet seemingly redundant, occur during the climatic moments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe origin story films, and why producers often cast lesser-known actors as leads in them. Drawing upon the fields of celebrity studies and media industry studies, this paper considers these two questions to be interlinked, and accordingly proposes a two-part answer to them. It first considers what these non-A list stars bring to superhero origin movies with regards to existing economic value, degree of fame, and star trajectory. It thus reads the casting of lesser-known stars as leads in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a canny strategy by Marvel Studios to manage paratextual star narratives and trajectories, the verisimilitude of the onscreen fantasy, and the studio's present and future bargaining leverage. Subsequently, this paper argues that this combination of producer strategies is an updating of the oneiric climate that Umberto Eco has compellingly argued to be a structural necessity for texts which operate within the superhero metagenre. These combined strategies are read as treating the superhero as a postmodern star, asserting the primacy of the character - as opposed to the actor - as the primary attraction for the present and future audiences of these franchises.","[Koh, Wilson] Univ Queensland, Sch English Media Studies & Art Hist, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Koh, W (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch English Media Studies & Art Hist, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",double.innuneko@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1939-2397,1939-2400,,CELEBR STUD,Celebr.

Whilst the more relaxed cultural climate of the Thaw allowed the Theatre to play with the avant-garde legacy of physical theatre and create a space for deafness on the stage, the experience of the Theatre exposes the complexities of Khrushchev-era theatrical engagement, which was torn between a push towards grassroots expression of minority identity and increasing attempts to control and direct culture as a means to build an idealised New Soviet Person.","Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Shaw, C (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",,,"Shaw, Claire/0000-0003-2504-247X",,,,,76,5,5,0,7,MODERN HUMANITIES RESEARCH ASSOCIATION,LONDON,"1 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AF, ENGLAND",0037-6795,2222-4327,,SLAVON E EUR REV,Slav.

Commercial shipping constitutes a large and concentrated aerosol perturbation in a meteorological regime where clouds have a disproportionally large effect on climate. Yet, to date, studies have been unable to detect climatologically relevant cloud radiative effects from shipping, despite models indicating that the cloud response should produce a sizable negative radiative forcing (perturbation to Earth's energy balance). We attribute a significant increase in cloud reflectivity to enhanced cloud droplet number concentrations within a major shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic. Prevailing winds constrain emissions around the corridor, which cuts through a climatically important region of expansive low cloud cover. We use universal kriging, a classic geostatistical method, to estimate what cloud properties would have been in the absence of shipping. In the morning, cloud brightening is consistent with changes in microphysics alone, whereas in the afternoon, increases in cloud brightness from microphysical changes are offset by decreases in the total amount of cloud water. We calculate an effective radiative forcing within the southeast Atlantic shipping corridor of approximately -2 W/m(2). Several years of data are required to identify a clear signal. Extrapolating our results globally, we calculate an effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions in low clouds of -1.0 W/m(2) (95% confidence interval: -1.6 to -0.4 W/m(2)). The unique setup in the southeast Atlantic could be an ideal test for the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. Plain Language Summary One of the biggest challenges in quantifying the human influence on Earth's climate is understanding how small airborne particles (aerosol) influence cloud properties. Increasing aerosol increases the brightness of low-lying clouds, exerting a cooling effect on the climate that partially offsets some of the warming caused by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Ship tracks, or lines of cloud changes due to pollution from individual ships, have long been studied as a prime example of these cloud-aerosol interactions in action. Mysteriously, however, previous attempts to measure ship tracks globally found very small effects, even though climate models predict large effects. We analyze a shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic where the winds blow in such a way that the ships' pollution remains constrained around the corridor. This allows us to estimate what the clouds in the shipping corridor would look like without the effects of ships by using the properties of nearby, non-shipping-affected clouds. For the first time, we observe a substantial increase in cloud brightness caused by shipping on a regional scale. Applying cloud-aerosol relationships calculated within the shipping corridor to state-of-the-art climate model data, we estimate how much pollution-induced cloud changes have changed Earth's energy balance since the pre-industrial era.","[Diamond, Michael S.; Eastman, Ryan; Wood, Robert] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Diamond, Michael S.; Director, Hannah M.] Univ Washington, Program Climate Change, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Director, Hannah M.] Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Possner, Anna] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Atmosphere & Environm Sci, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Diamond, MS (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Diamond, MS (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Program Climate Change, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",diamond2@uw.edu,"Wood, Robert/A-2989-2008; Possner, Anna/I-2779-2018; Diamond, Michael/GXG-7308-2022; Possner, Anna/GOE-6996-2022; Diamond, Michael/AAA-9206-2021; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","Wood, Robert/0000-0002-1401-3828; Possner, Anna/0000-0001-6996-8624; Diamond, Michael/0000-0003-2147-5921; Eastman, Ryan/0000-0001-8696-4211; Director, Hannah/0000-0002-1874-5102",NASA Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program [NNX-80NSSC17K0404]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1256082]; NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-2 grant [NNX-15AF98G],NASA Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-2 grant,"M.

LCAs with practical outcomes are explored, such as the carbon footprint of reusable vs single-use anaesthetic devices (e.g. drug trays, laryngoscope blades, and handles), and the carbon footprint of treating an ICU patient with septic shock. Avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, and reprocess are then explored. Moving beyond routine clinical care, the vital influences that the source of energy (renewables vs fossil fuels) and energy efficiency have in healthcare's ecological footprint are highlighted.

The prediction of summer rainfall anomalies in East Asia is difficult, while the WTP has a strong correlation between model prediction and observation. We focus on developing a new approach to further enhance the seasonal prediction skill for summer rainfall in East Asia and investigate the influence of convective activity in the WTP on East Asian summer rainfall. By analyzing the characteristics of the WTP convection, two distinct patterns associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation developing and decaying modes are identified. Based on the multiple linear regression method, the East Asia Rainfall Index (EARI) is developed by using the interannual variability of the normalized Maritime continent-WTP Indices (MPIs), as potentially useful predictors for rainfall prediction over East Asia, obtained from the above two main patterns. For East Asian summer rainfall, the EARI has superior performance to the East Asia summer monsoon index or each MPI. Therefore, the regressed rainfall from EARI also shows a strong relationship with the observed East Asian summer rainfall pattern. In addition, we evaluate the prediction skill of the East Asia reconstructed rainfall obtained by hybrid dynamical-statistical approach using the cross-validated EARI from the individual models and their MME. The results show that the rainfalls reconstructed from simulations capture the general features of observed precipitation in East Asia quite well. This study convincingly demonstrates that rainfall prediction skill is considerably improved by using a hybrid dynamical-statistical approach compared to the dynamical forecast alone.","[Lee, Doo Young; Ahn, Joong-Bae] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan 609735, South Korea; [Yoo, Jin-Ho] APEC Climate Ctr APCC, Busan, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Ahn, JB (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Busan 609735, South Korea.",jbahn@pusan.ac.kr,"Lee, Doo Young/Y-7588-2019","Lee, Doo Young/0000-0002-6129-2241; Lee, Doo Y./0000-0001-9891-828X","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2014R1A6A3A01009455]; Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [CATER 2012-3100]; Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development, Republic of Korea [PJ009353]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program(Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)); Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development, Republic of Korea","The authors acknowledge the APCC MME Producing Centres for making their hindcast/forecast data available for analysis, the APEC Climate Center for collecting and archiving them and for organizing APCC MME prediction.

However, other Ecosystem Services (ES) became increasingly relevant in response to the challenges of urbanization and climate change. In total, 90 scientific articles addressing ES considered crucial contributions to the quality of life in cities are reviewed. These are classified as (1) regulating ES that minimize hazards such as heat, floods, air pollution and noise, and (2) cultural ES that promote well-being and health. We conclude that the planning and design of UGI should balance both the provision of ES and their side effects and disservices, aspects that seem to have been only marginally investigated. Climate-sensitive planning practices are critical to guarantee that seasonal climate variability is accounted for at high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, diverging and seemingly inconsistent findings, together with gaps in the understanding of long-term effects, create obstacles for practitioners. Additionally, the limited involvement of end users points to a need of better engagement and communication, which in overall call for more collaborative research. Close relationships and interactions among different ES provided by urban greenery were found, yet few studies attempted an integrated evaluation. We argue that promoting interdisciplinary studies is fundamental to attain a holistic understanding of how plant traits affect the resulting ES; of the synergies between biophysical, physiological and psychological processes; and of the potential disservices of UGI, specifically in Nordic cities.","[Amorim, Jorge H.; Ribeiro, Isabel] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Engardt, Magnuz; Johansson, Christer; Sannebro, Magnus] Environm & Hlth Adm, Box 8136, S-10420 Stockholm, Sweden; [Johansson, Christer] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute; Stockholm University,"Amorim, JH (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",jorge.amorim@smhi.se; magnuz.engardt@slb.nu; christer.johansson@slb.nu; isabel.ribeiro@smhi.se; magnus.sannebro@stockholm.se,"Amorim, Jorge Humberto h/E-7515-2010; Johansson, Christer/C-6451-2011; Ribeiro, Isabel/D-5465-2014","Amorim, Jorge Humberto h/0000-0002-2074-7764; Johansson, Christer/0000-0002-8459-9852; Ribeiro, Isabel/0000-0001-6611-5167; Engardt, Magnuz/0000-0002-4695-1106","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) [2017-01960, 2018-02870]","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas)","This research was funded by the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) through the projects Green infrastructure and climate in Nordic cities, today and in the future: state-of-the-art and knowledge gaps on interactions and impacts (G.I.Nord, ref.: 2017-01960) and Heat stress in Swedish cities and the role of urban nature (GreenWave, ref.: 2018-02870).",,117,11,11,12,51,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

There are increasing activities related to oil and gas exploration, tourism, cargo transport, and fishing in the Arctic. Ice accretion can cause vessel instability, excess load on marine structures, and represents a safety risk for outdoor working environment and operations. Freezing sea spray is the main contributor to marine icing. For safe operations in cold climates, it is essential to have verified models for the prediction of icing. Sea spray icing forecast models have improved. Empirical and theoretical models providing icing rates based may be useful as guidelines. For predicting the distribution of icing on a surface at the design stage, computational fluid dynamics has to be applied along with a freezing module. State-of-the-art models for numerical simulation of sea spray icing are still not fully capable of modeling complex ship-sea-wind interactions with spray generation and impact of shipped water. Existing models include a good understanding of spray flow effects and freezing. Further development should focus on developing models for dynamic ship-sea-wind interactions, in particular including spray generation, effects of shipped water, and distribution of icing on the vessel surface. More experimental and full-scale data are needed for the development and verification of new and improved models. Models that estimate ice distribution may improve the winterization design process and reduce the effort required for de-icing. Improved methods for de-icing and anti-icing will reduce the impact of sea spray icing and increase safety for marine operations in cold waters.","[Deshpande, Sujay; Sundsbo, Per-Arne] Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Bldg Energy & Mat Technol, UiT, Campus Narvik,Lodve Langesgate 2, N-8514 Narvik, Norway; [Saeterdal, Ane] Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Comp Sci & Computat Engn, UiT, Campus Narvik,Lodve Langesgate 2, N-8514 Narvik, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Deshpande, S (corresponding author), Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Bldg Energy & Mat Technol, UiT, Campus Narvik,Lodve Langesgate 2, N-8514 Narvik, Norway.",sujay.r.deshpande@uit.no; ane.saterdal@uit.no; per-arne.sundsbo@uit.no,,"Deshpande, Sujay/0000-0002-5426-017X",,,,,81,4,4,4,17,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0892-7219,1528-896X,,J OFFSHORE MECH ARCT,J.

There are indications that cold winters in the Arctic stratosphere have been getting colder, raising the question if and to what extent a cooling of the Arctic stratosphere may continue into the future. We use meteorological reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) for the past 32 yr together with calculations of the chemistry-climate model (CCM) ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) and models from the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) project to infer radiative and dynamical contributions to long-term Arctic stratospheric temperature changes. For the past three decades the reanalyses show a warming trend in winter and cooling trend in spring and summer, which agree well with trends from the Radiosonde Innovation Composite Homogenization (RICH) adjusted radiosonde data set. Changes in winter and spring are caused by a corresponding change of planetary wave activity with increases in winter and decreases in spring. During winter the increase of planetary wave activity is counteracted by a residual radiatively induced cooling. Stratospheric radiatively induced cooling is detected throughout all seasons, being highly significant in spring and summer. This means that for a given dynamical situation, according to ERA-Interim the annual mean temperature of the Arctic lower stratosphere has been cooling by -0.41 +/- 0.11K decade(-1) at 50 hPa over the past 32 yr. Calculations with state-of-the-art models from CCMVal and the EMAC model qualitatively reproduce the radiatively induced cooling for the past decades, but underestimate the amount of radiatively induced cooling deduced from reanalyses. There are indications that this discrepancy could be partly related to a possible underestimation of past Arctic ozone trends in the models. The models project a continued cooling of the Arctic stratosphere over the coming decades (2001-2049) that is for the annual mean about 40% less than the modeled cooling for the past, due to the reduction of ozone depleting substances and the resulting ozone recovery. This projected cooling in turn could offset between 15 and 40% of the Arctic ozone recovery.","[Bohlinger, P.; Sinnhuber, B. -M.; Ruhnke, R.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Kirner, O.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Sinnhuber, BM (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway.",bjoern-martin.sinnhuber@kit.edu,"Kirner, Oliver/K-8815-2015; Sinnhuber, Björn-Martin/A-7007-2013; Ruhnke, Roland/J-8800-2012","Kirner, Oliver/0000-0001-5668-6177; Sinnhuber, Björn-Martin/0000-0001-9608-7320; Ruhnke, Roland/0000-0002-0353-1603",German Helmholtz Association through its research programme Atmosphere and Climate (ATMO); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the Research Unit SHARP,German Helmholtz Association through its research programme Atmosphere and Climate (ATMO); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the Research Unit SHARP(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Parts of this work were supported by the German Helmholtz Association through its research programme Atmosphere and Climate (ATMO) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the Research Unit SHARP.

Over the Sahel region, a megadrought during the 1960s and 1970s induced by an abrupt and substantial rainfall reduction caused widespread famine and death. The postdrought recovery, which is still ongoing, has been characterized by gradual increases in rainfall, but with dramatic fluctuations. The large negative human impacts, slow recovery, and variability raise important questions of why and how rainfall dynamics evolve and interact with other components of the regional climate system. Here we provide an observational assessment of rainfall interactions mechanisms (informed by directional transfer of information entropy) that regulate Sahel rainfall. We quantitatively demonstrate that (1) sea surface temperature over the Gulf of Guinea controls moisture advection and transport to the West Sahel region and (2) strong bidirectional interactions exist between local vegetation dynamics and rainfall patterns. Then we assess the directional interaction patterns from nine state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs). We find that most ESMs are able to represent either the unidirectional control of sea surface temperature on precipitation or the bidirectional interaction between vegetation and precipitation. However, none of the ESMs represents both interactive patterns. The GFDL and IPSL-CM5A-LR models successfully reproduced observed patterns over similar to 50% of the West Sahel region but were not accurate in reproducing observed precipitation regional trends or interannual variation. We propose that the directional information transfer is a powerful mechanistic benchmark to assess model fidelity at the process level.","[Liu, Bessie Y.; Ma, Hongxu; Van Gordon, Mollie; Larsen, Laurel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhu, Qing; Riley, William J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhao, Lei] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Champaign, IL USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Zhu, Q (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",qzhu@lbl.gov,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Zhao, Lei/S-1855-2019; Zhu, Qing/G-2433-2015","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Zhao, Lei/0000-0002-6481-3786; Zhu, Qing/0000-0003-2441-944X; Ma, Hongxu/0000-0003-0411-5895; Van Gordon, Mollie/0000-0002-1384-3977","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Regional and Global Climate Modeling (RGCM), RUBISCO SFA [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Regional and Global Climate Modeling (RGCM), RUBISCO SFA","This research is supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 as part of the Regional and Global Climate Modeling (RGCM), RUBISCO SFA.

We investigated the relative importance of climate change vs. land use change for four Alpine catchments using the LPJ-GUESS model. Two scenarios of grassland management were calibrated based on the more detailed model PROGRASS. The simulations until 2100 show that only reforestation could lead to an increase of carbon storage under climatic change, whereby a cessation of carbon accumulation occurred in all catchments after 2050. The initial increase in carbon storage was attributable mainly to forest re-growth on abandoned land, whereas the stagnation and decline in the second half of the century was mainly driven by climate change. If land was used more intensively, i.e. as grassland, litter input to the soil decreased due to harvesting, resulting in a decline of soil carbon storage (1.2-2.9 kg C m(-2)) that was larger than the climate-induced change (0.8-1.4 kg C m(-2)). Land use change influenced transpiration both directly and in interaction with climate change. The response of forested catchments diverged with climatic change (11-40 mm increase in AET), reflecting the differences in forest age, topography and water holding capacity within and between catchments. For grass-dominated catchments, however, transpiration responded in a similar manner to climate change (light management: 23-32 mm AET decrease, heavy management: 29-44 mm AET decrease), likely because grassroots are concentrated in the uppermost soil layers. Both the water and the carbon cycle were more strongly influenced by land use compared to climatic changes, as land use had not only a direct effect on carbon storage and transpiration, but also an indirect effect by modifying the climate change response of transpiration and carbon flux in the catchments. For the carbon cycle, climate change led to a cessation of the catchment response (sink/source strength is limited), whereas for the water cycle, the effect of land use change remains evident throughout the simulation period (changes in evapotranspiration do not attenuate). Thus we conclude that management will have a large potential to influence the carbon and water cycle, which needs to be considered in management planning as well as in climate and hydrological modelling.","[Wolf, Annett; Bugmann, Harald] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lazzarotto, Patrick] Forsch Anstalt Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture,"Wolf, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Dept Environm Sci, Univ Str 16, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",annett.wolf@env.ethz.ch,"Bugmann, Harald/A-1252-2008","Bugmann, Harald/0000-0003-4233-0094",NCCR climate; EU,NCCR climate(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); EU(European Commission),"We thank the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (AIC) at ETHZ and the Land Use Dynamics Group, WSL Birmensdorf for providing climate data.

The SPG shift triggers multicentennial anomalies in the North Atlantic climate driven by long-lasting internal feedbacks relating anomalous oceanic and atmospheric circulation, sea ice extent, and upper-ocean salinity in the Labrador Sea. Yet changes throughout or after the shift are not associated with a persistent weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation or shifts in the North Atlantic Oscillation. The anomalous climate state of the North Atlantic simulated after the shift agrees well with climate reconstructions from within the area, which describe a transition between a stronger and weaker SPG during the relatively warm medieval climate and the cold Little Ice Age respectively. However, model and data differ in the timing of the onset. The simulated SPG shift is caused by a rapid increase in the freshwater export from the Arctic and associated freshening in the upper Labrador Sea. Such freshwater anomaly relates to prominent thickening of the Arctic sea ice, following the cluster of relatively small-magnitude volcanic eruptions by 1600 CE. Sensitivity experiments without volcanic forcing can nonetheless produce similar abrupt events; a necessary causal link between the volcanic cluster and the SPG shift can therefore be excluded. Instead, preconditioning by internal variability explains discrepancies in the timing between the simulated SPG shift and the reconstructed estimates for the Little Ice Age onset.","[Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo; Lohmann, Katja; Jungclaus, Johann H.] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo] Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modeling, Hamburg, Germany; [Zanchettin, Davide] Univ Venice, Venice, Italy",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Moreno-Chamarro, E (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany.;Moreno-Chamarro, E (corresponding author), Int Max Planck Res Sch Earth Syst Modeling, Hamburg, Germany.",eduardo.chamarro@mpimet.mpg.de,"Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/ABF-9676-2021","Moreno-Chamarro, Eduardo/0000-0002-7931-5149",Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology),Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology),"Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology).

The effect can be reflected also in a larger cloud fraction and an increase in the condensate mass that is distributed higher in the atmospheric column. Identifying the invigoration effect by aerosols requires attributing certain changes in cloud dynamics to changes in cloud microphysics. More than 10 years of extensive research using data collected in field experiments, analysis of satellite measurements and the employment of state-of-the-art numerical models have been used in an attempt to study this elusive phenomenon. Despite these intensive efforts, the validity of the invigoration effect and the possibility of climate responses to this effect are still considered to be open questions. In this review observational evidence and modeling results for cloud invigoration are discussed. Studies that indicate convective cloud invigoration effects, as well as studies that suggest no or even opposite effects are summarized. A coherent physical mechanism that describes a chain of processes that takes place under the proper conditions in the core of a convective cloud provides explanation for the ideal case of invigoration reported by observations and numerical modeling, while the competition between core-based vs. margin-based processes explains the cases that deviate from the ideal. Because convective clouds play a key role in the Earth's radiation balance, in the water cycle and atmospheric circulations, invigoration implies possible consequences at scales ranging from a single cloud up to the global.

Compared to state-of-the-art observations, improvements in tropical precipitation in the CMIP6 models are identified for some metrics, but we find no general improvement in tropical precipitation on different temporal and spatial scales. Our results indicate overall little changes across the CMIP phases for the summer monsoons, the double-ITCZ bias, and the diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation. We find a reduced amount of drizzle events in CMIP6, but tropical precipitation occurs still too frequently. Continuous improvements across the CMIP phases are identified for the number of consecutive dry days, for the representation of modes of variability, namely, the Madden-Julian oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and for the trends in dry months in the twentieth century. The observed positive trend in extreme wet months is, however, not captured by any of the CMIP phases, which simulate negative trends for extremely wet months in the twentieth century. The regional biases are larger than a climate change signal one hopes to use the models to identify. Given the pace of climate change as compared to the pace of model improvements to simulate tropical precipitation, we question the past strategy of the development of the present class of global climate models as the mainstay of the scientific response to climate change. We suggest the exploration of alternative approaches such as high-resolution storm-resolving models that can offer better prospects to inform us about how tropical precipitation might change with anthropogenic warming.","[Fiedler, Stephanie] Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany; [Fiedler, Stephanie; Crueger, Traute; D'Agostino, Roberta; Becker, Tobias; Leutwyler, David; Paccini, Laura; Dauhut, Thibaut; Fraedrich, Klaus; Jungandreas, Leonore; Maher, Nicola; Naumann, Ann Kristin; Rugenstein, Maria; Sakradzija, Mirjana; Schmidt, Hauke; Stephan, Claudia; Timmreck, Claudia; Zhu, Xiuhua; Stevens, Bjorn] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Peters, Karsten] Deutsch Klimarechenzentrum DKRZ, Hamburg, Germany; [Burdanowitz, Joerg; Buehler, Stefan A.; Sielmann, Frank] Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Cortes, Alejandro Uribe] Stockholm Univ, MISU, Stockholm, Sweden; [Dommenget, Dietmar] Monash Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Cologne; Max Planck Society; University of Hamburg; Stockholm University; Monash University,"Fiedler, S (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Geophys & Meteorol, Cologne, Germany.",stephanie.fiedler@uni-koeln.de,"D'Agostino, Roberta/N-9527-2018; Peters-von Gehlen, Karsten/A-3164-2012; Stephan, Claudia Christine/AAL-4455-2020; D'Agostino, Roberta/AAZ-3621-2020; Zhu, Xiuhua/AAM-1420-2021; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/A-4056-2009; Stevens, Bjorn/A-1757-2013; UzK, IGMK/HGU-4003-2022; Sakradzija, Mirjana/GNO-9424-2022; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","D'Agostino, Roberta/0000-0002-0717-6186; Peters-von Gehlen, Karsten/0000-0003-0158-2957; Stephan, Claudia Christine/0000-0001-5736-1948; D'Agostino, Roberta/0000-0002-0717-6186; Buehler, Stefan Alexander/0000-0001-6389-1160; Stevens, Bjorn/0000-0003-3795-0475; Naumann, Ann Kristin/0000-0002-5057-6038; Leutwyler, David/0000-0002-5141-1737; Fiedler, Stephanie/0000-0001-8898-9949; Paccini, Laura/0000-0002-0693-4141; Maher, Nicola/0000-0003-3922-9833","Max Planck Society; Hans-Ertel Centre for Weather Research (HErZ); European Union [820829]; DFG [1211, 268236062, FOR 2820, 398006378, FOR 1740]; Swiss National Science Foundation [178503]; JPIBelmont forum project PaCMEDy; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (DFG) [EXC 2037, 390683824]; Australian Research Council [CE170100023]",Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); Hans-Ertel Centre for Weather Research (HErZ); European Union(European Commission); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); JPIBelmont forum project PaCMEDy; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the Max Planck Society and the Hans-Ertel Centre for Weather Research (HErZ) for the financial support of this study.

A considerable number of forest models have been developed in the last decades. However, few systematic and comprehensive model comparisons have been performed in Europe that combine an evaluation of modelled carbon and water fluxes and forest structure. We evaluate 13 widely used, state-of-the-art, stand-scale forest models against field measurements of forest structure and eddy-covariance data of carbon and water fluxes over multiple decades across an environmental gradient at nine typical European forest stands. We test the models' performance in three dimensions: accuracy of local predictions (agreement of modelled and observed annual data), realism of environmental responses (agreement of modelled and observed responses of daily gross primary productivity to temperature, radiation and vapour pressure deficit) and general applicability (proportion of European tree species covered). We find that multiple models are available that excel according to our three dimensions of model performance. For the accuracy of local predictions, variables related to forest structure have lower random and systematic errors than annual carbon and water flux variables. Moreover, the multi-model ensemble mean provided overall more realistic daily productivity responses to environmental drivers across all sites than any single individual model. The general applicability of the models is high, as almost all models are currently able to cover Europe's common tree species. We show that forest models complement each other in their response to environmental drivers and that there are several cases in which individual models outperform the model ensemble. Our framework provides a first step to capturing essential differences between forest models that go beyond the most commonly used accuracy of predictions. Overall, this study provides a point of reference for future model work aimed at predicting climate impacts and supporting climate mitigation and adaptation measures in forests.","[Mahnken, Mats; Lasch-Born, Petra; del Valle, Iliusi D.

Preparing funding proposals for submission to sponsors is a faculty behavior that can be modified by applying behavioral theory to develop and institute interventions for shaping the desired behavior. The Theory of Planned Behavior readily lends itself to research management methods and techniques that target critical factors influencing intentional behavior.

However, the ability of seasonal forecasting systems to predict OHC remains largely untested. Here, we present a global assessment of OHC predictability in two state-of-the-art and fully-coupled seasonal forecasting systems. Overall, we find that dynamical systems make skilful seasonal predictions of OHC in the upper 300 m across a range of forecast start times, seasons and dynamical environments. Predictions of OHC are typically as skilful as predictions of sea surface temperature (SST), providing further proof that accurate representation of subsurface heat contributes to accurate surface predictions. We also compare dynamical systems to a simple anomaly persistence model to identify where dynamical systems provide added value over cheaper forecasts; this largely occurs in the equatorial regions and the tropics, and to a greater extent in the latter part of the forecast period. Regions where system performance is inadequate include the sub-polar regions and areas dominated by sharp fronts, which should be the focus of future improvements of climate forecasting systems.","[McAdam, Ronan; Masina, Simona] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Ocean Modeling & Data Assimilat Div, Bologna, Italy; [Balmaseda, Magdalena; Senan, Retish; Mayer, Michael] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Gualdi, Silvio] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Climate Simulat & Predict Div, Bologna, Italy; [Mayer, Michael] Univ Vienna, Dept Meteorol & Geophys, Vienna, Austria",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF); University of Vienna,"McAdam, R (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Ocean Modeling & Data Assimilat Div, Bologna, Italy.",ronan.mcadam@cmcc.it,"Senan, Retish/AAF-1798-2019; Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015","Senan, Retish/0000-0003-1949-1893; Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Alonso Balmaseda, Magdalena/0000-0002-9611-8788; McAdam, Ronan/0000-0003-0883-9014",project 'Improving and Integrating European Ocean Observing and Forecasting Systems for Sustainable use of the Oceans' - 'EuroSea' within the Work Package 4 - European Union under H2020 grant [862626]; European Union [690462],project 'Improving and Integrating European Ocean Observing and Forecasting Systems for Sustainable use of the Oceans' - 'EuroSea' within the Work Package 4 - European Union under H2020 grant; European Union(European Commission),"This work was supported by the project 'Improving and Integrating European Ocean Observing and Forecasting Systems for Sustainable use of the Oceans' - 'EuroSea' within the Work Package 4, funded by the European Union under H2020 grant agreement number 862626.

In this paper we are dealing with with a fundamental optical digital design concept. An optical automated logic design process is described, under a linear optics model assumption. We use optimization theory and maximum feasibility set (MAX-FS) inspired heuristics to solve the problem of finding optimal performance weights and optical thresholds for the implementation of a digital/switching function with linear optics. This optical design automation (ODA) may evolve into a rapid prototyping environment for fabless opto-electronics companies to receive custom programming for opto-electronic circuits from system engineers.

The transport sector alone, which encompasses all other industrial sectors, has grown with regard to its energy demand by 50% over the past 30 years. The aim of this paper is to promote a dialogue as to whether an economy based on biomass can be more sustainable than today's existing economies, considering that the economy needs to expand and be boosted, while creating a cascading and recycling system. This semi-systematic review paper discusses four research questions based on findings from the last 20 years: (i) What are the crucial issues in the ongoing debate on the development of a sustainable bioeconomy concept? (ii) Where are the major conflicting points and focuses? (iii) How does the bioeconomy follow current urbanization and land-abandonment trends? (iv) How will the crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic change these previous scenarios? As it is not easy to currently predict which pathway will be the most effective, whether it be the one taken as of now or a specific novel pathway, this article recommends following a strategy that is diverse regarding its approaches to shaping the bioeconomy and further funding of renewable energy sources, along with the involvement of urban planning.

The outcomes highlight that gas engine heat pumps could have better environmental performance compared to electric heat pumps both in heating and cooling operations. Moreover, they could play a pivotal role in the fight against climate change and energy security since they can guarantee an energy mix differentiation moving from electricity to natural gas and renewable gases' usage. Indeed, by 2030, a lower-carbon gas grid could be supported by renewable gases. A further investigation has concerned diffusion of gas heat pumps activated from biofuels produced by local biomass in an energy community scenario based on a low-temperature energy district network.

In general business and industry in the oil and gas business are using computer simulations on a daily basis. In this case it is using computer simulations to gain understanding of the risk of a new technology which would affect the subsurface on a large scale and hence in Europe a substantial amount of people. So far, research did not consider in depth patterns of in silico science for policy. This paper analyses how policy-makers process and use simulation data based on a case-study of geo-scientific carbon dioxide capture modeling. The empirical results are based on 19 qualitative interviews with decision-makers from politics, business and industry, and society. The empirical results reveal a great variety of co-existing perception, evaluation and use patterns of how decision-makers deal with simulations. The field work reveals that the current state-of-the-art in research literature which emphasizes an overall misperception, misunderstanding and misuse of simulation data by policy-makers is, in general, not backed by the case-study results.

At present, only a few properties are reliably retrieved from space, either directly or via water-leaving radiance. Existing satellite products are limited to planar photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiance above the surface and diffuse attenuation coefficient. Examples of operational products are provided, and their advantages and drawbacks are examined. The usefulness and convenience of these products notwithstanding, there is a need, as expressed by the user community, for other products, i.e., sub-surface planar and scalar fluxes, average cosine, spectral fluxes (UV to visible), diurnal fluxes, absorbed fraction of PAR by live algae (APAR), surface albedo, vertical attenuation, and heating rate, and for associating uncertainties to any product on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Methodologies to obtain the new products are qualitatively discussed in view of most recent scientific knowledge and current and future satellite missions, and specific algorithms are presented for some new products, namely sub-surface fluxes and average cosine. A strategy and roadmap (short, medium, and long term) for usage and development priorities is provided, taking into account needs and readiness level. Combining observations from satellites overpassing at different times and geostationary satellites should be pursued to improve the quality of daily-integrated radiation fields, and products should be generated without gaps to provide boundary conditions for general circulation and biogeochemical models. Examples of new products, i.e., daily scalar PAR below the surface, daily average cosine for PAR, and sub-surface spectral scalar fluxes are presented. A procedure to estimate algorithm uncertainties in the total uncertainty budget for above-surface daily PAR, based on radiative simulations for expected situations, is described. In the future, space-borne lidars with ocean profiling capability offer the best hope for improving our knowledge of sub-surface fields. To maximize temporal coverage, space agencies should consider placing ocean-color instruments in L1 orbit, where the sunlit part of the Earth can be frequently observed.","[Frouin, Robert; Tan, Jing] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Ramon, Didier; Jolivet, Dominique; Compiegne, Mathieu] HYGEOS, Eliratechnol, Lille, France; [Boss, Emmanuel] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USA; [Bouman, Heather] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford, England; [Jackson, Thomas; Plett, Trevor; Sathyendranath, Shubha] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Franz, Bryan] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Oxford; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,"Frouin, R (corresponding author), Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",rfrouin@ucsd.edu,"Boss, Emmanuel/C-5765-2009; Boss, Emmanuel/AAF-2336-2019","Boss, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8334-9595; Boss, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8334-9595; Jackson, Thomas/0000-0003-4336-1597; Sathyendranath, Shubha/0000-0003-3586-192X",National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX14AL91G]; European Space Agency (ESA) [40001 1 3690/1 4/I-LG]; NERC [pml010008] Funding Source: UKRI,National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); European Space Agency (ESA)(European Space Agency); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) provided funding for the study under Grant NNX14AL91G and Contract 40001 1 3690/1 4/I-LG, respectively.",,64,20,20,1,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

In recent years there has been an unexplained increase in P cresphontes occurrences along the northeastern periphery of its geographical range. This study examined historical records to describe the movement of P. cresphontes populations into New York State and adjacent Ontario. Climate data and field studies were used to identify, environmental factors that may influence the range expansion, which was found to correspond with an absence of September frosts beginning in 2001. Field studies indicated that some P cresphontes larvae were capable of withstanding multiple frosts and descended to pupate normally into late October in the range expansion area. Although the larvae may have adapted to endure cooler temperatures to some degree, the effects of warming temperatures on other factors such as natural enemies and larval host plant quality in autumn may influence the spread of P cresphontes populations at least as much as larval frost tolerance.","[Finkbeiner, Susan D.; Reed, Robert D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Finkbeiner, Susan D.; Losey, John E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Dirig, Robert] Cornell Univ, Plant Pathol Herbarium, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Finkbeiner, SD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",sfinkbei@uci.edu,"Reed, Robert D/A-2419-2008","Reed, Robert/0000-0002-6065-6728",Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences,Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences,Thanks to Jeffry Petracca for field assistance and help gathering occurrence reports; Ann Hajek for examining cadavers and providing useful information on parasitoids; Karen Edelstein for aid in fieldwork; Jessica Rennells at the Northeast Regional Climate Center for detailed frost records; Art Shapiro and two anonymous reviewers for manuscript suggestions; Betsy Darlington and Andy Zepp for approving research permits at the Salmon Creek Finger Lakes Land Trust Preserve; The Natural Areas Committee of Cornell Plantations for permission to conduct field work at the Eames Memorial Natural Area; The Comstock Memorial Library for allowing access to the rare book collection; and the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Honors Program for funding this project.,,33,5,5,0,14,LEPIDOPTERISTS SOC,LOS ANGELES,"900 EXPOSITION BLVD, LOS ANGELES, CA 90007-4057 USA",0024-0966,,,J LEPID SOC,J.

Difficult snow conditions have been found to decrease the calving success and survivability of reindeer, but the economic effects of variation in winter conditions on reindeer husbandry have not been studied. In this study, we combine state-of-the-art economic-ecological modeling with the analysis of annual reindeer management reports from Finland. These contain local knowledge of herding communities. We quantify the occurrence probabilities of different types of winters from annual management reports and analyze the effects of this variation in winter conditions on reindeer husbandry using an age- and sex-structured bioeconomic reindeer-lichen model. Our results show that difficult winters decrease the net revenues of reindeer husbandry. However, they also protect lichen pastures from grazing, thereby increasing future net revenues. Nonetheless, our solutions show that the variability of winter conditions overall decrease the net income of herders compared to constant winter conditions. Low lichen biomass appears to make reindeer management more sensitive to the effects of difficult winter conditions. We also found that it is economically sensible to use supplementary feeding during difficult winters, but the net revenues still decrease compared to average winters because of the high feeding costs. Overall, our analysis suggests that the increasing variability of winter conditions due to climate change will decrease net revenues in reindeer husbandry. This decrease will still occur even if the most extreme effects of climate change do not occur. This study shows that combining a state-of-the-art bioeconomic model and practitioner knowledge can bring compatible insights, ideas, results, and a bottom-up perspective to the discussion.","[Pekkarinen, Antti-Juhani] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Pekkarinen, Antti-Juhani; Tahvonen, Olli] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Rasmus, Sirpa] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Kumpula, Jouko] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Kaamanen, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Helsinki; University of Lapland; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Pekkarinen, AJ (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland, Helsinki, Finland.;Pekkarinen, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",antti-juhani.pekkarinen@luke.fi,,,Maa- ja MetsatalousministeriO; NordForsk [76915]; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,Maa- ja MetsatalousministeriO; NordForsk; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,"Maa- ja MetsatalousministeriO; NordForsk, Grant/Award Number: project number 76915; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry",,48,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

It is a prominent environmental risk to built heritage, as it contributes to the damage of porous building materials and building element failure. While predicted climate trends are well-established, how they will specifically manifest in future WDR is uncertain. This paper combines UKCP09 Weather Generator predictions with a probabilistic process to create hourly time series of climate parameters under a high-emissions scenario for 2070-2099 at eight UK sites. Exposure to WDR at these sites for baseline and future periods is calculated from semi-empirical models based on long-term hourly meteorological data using ISO 15927-3: 2009. Towards the end of the twenty-first century, it is predicted that rain spells will have higher volumes, i.e. a higher quantity of water will impact facades, across all 8 sites. Although the average number of spells is predicted to remain constant, they will be shorter with longer of periods of time between them and more intense with wind-driven rain occurring for a greater proportion of hours within them. It is likely that in this scenario building element failure-such as moisture ingress through cracks and gutter over-spill-will occur more frequently. There will be higher rates of moisture cycling and enhanced deep-seated wetting. These predicted changes require new metrics for wind-driven rain to be developed, so that future impacts can be managed effectively and efficiently. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Our results reveal that the positive phase of the IPO has a negative impact on Sahel rainfall anomalies regardless of the externally forced changes induced by anthropogenic gases. Such relationship is stronger for those models in which sea surface temperatures associated with the positive phase of the IPO show warmer anomalies over the tropical Pacific.

Desalinated seawater and wastewater are relatively reliable but expensive. Water from natural resources like reservoirs is generally cheaper but climate sensitive. We propose combining the operation of a reservoir and seawater and wastewater desalination plants for an overall system that is less vulnerable to scarcity and uncertainty, while constraining total cost. The joint system is modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem with the double objectives of minimizing risk and vulnerability, subject to a minimum limit on resilience. The joint model is applied to two cases, one based on the climate and demands of a location in India and the other of a location in California. The results for the Indian case indicate that it is possible for the joint system to reduce risk and vulnerability to zero given a budget increase of 20-120% under current climate conditions and 30-150% under projected future conditions. For the Californian case, this would require budget increases of 20-80% and 30-140% under current and future conditions, respectively. Further, our analysis shows a two-way interaction between the reservoir and desalination plants where the optimal operation of the former is just as much affected by the latter as the latter by the former. This highlights the importance of an integrated management approach. This study contributes to a greater quantitative understanding of desalination as a redundancy measure for adapting water supply infrastructures for a future of greater scarcity and uncertainty.","[Bhushan, Rashi; Ng, Tze Ling] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Ng, TL (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",tzeling@ust.hk,,"Ng, Tze Ling/0000-0002-3993-1625",General Research Fund (GRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [617012],General Research Fund (GRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong,"This work is supported by project 617012 of the General Research Fund (GRF) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong.

Rhetorical transformation from vibrations to rhythms, with their inscriptive capacity for ordering beyond material immediacies, is questioned, as is the reliance of both upon a naturalisation of cycles given that a unity of circadian and seasonal cycles has long been broken by climate change.","[Kahn, Douglas] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Art & Design, Media & Innovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kahn, D (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, UNSW Art & Design, Media & Innovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",douglas.kahn@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2055-1940,2055-1959,,SOUND STUD,Sound Stud.,2-Jan,2020,1,,,,14,28,,10.1080/20551940.2020.1713509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20551940.2020.1713509,,,15,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,TA5YH,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000667324600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Oslo Intercity Regional Model, comprising roughly 43 per cent of Norway's five million population, was used to study short distance trips in southeastern Norway, i.e. in and around the capital city of Oslo. The NTM6 model for domestic, long distance travel was used to analyze domestic trips longer than 70 km one way. Both of these are network models of travel demand, predicting car ownership, trip frequency, destination choice, mode choice and route choice under user specified input assumptions. The following three policy options have been studied: (i) tripled toll rates and ferry fares everywhere in Norway, (ii) a NOK 0.20 (= (sic) 0.024) per vehicle km road charge or equivalently higher fuel tax, and (iii) abolishment of the commuter tax credit, which in 2014 amounted to roughly (sic) 0.05 per km for long-distance commuters. By design, these three policy options give rise to similar reductions in CO2 emissions from travel. While option (i) turns out to be highly inefficient, options (ii) and (iii) appear, in a partial travel demand analysis, to be welfare increasing even before CO2 abatement benefits. However, when the policy options are ordered according to their equity effects, the ranking becomes completely reversed. The abolishment of the commuter tax credit appears to hit people in low income neighbourhoods five to fifteen times harder than those living in high income zones. The fuel tax increase gives rise to corresponding inequity ratios between three and seven. The main explanation is that residents of remote, low income areas generally sustain longer commutes, and also to a larger extent depend on their cars for commuting than do workers in densely populated urban or suburban districts.","[Steinsland, Christian; Fridstrom, Lasse; Madslien, Anne; Minken, Harald] Inst Transport Econ TOI, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Fridstrom, L (corresponding author), Inst Transport Econ TOI, Gaustadalleen 21, NO-0349 Oslo, Norway.",lef@toi.no,,"Fridstrom, Lasse/0000-0001-9205-7992",BISEK -a Swedish Norwegian research programme on the social and economic significance of the private car [TRV 2015/7976],BISEK -a Swedish Norwegian research programme on the social and economic significance of the private car,"This research was funded primarily through BISEK -a Swedish Norwegian research programme (TRV 2015/7976) on the social and economic significance of the private car.

However, windows are also often considered to be one of the weakest building components with respect to high thermal losses and are in addition often the reason for overheating and glare issues. In comparison to traditional static windows, dynamic solutions like adaptive and controllable smart windows have the ability to adjust their optical properties in response to changing boundary conditions and hence have the potential to improve the energy performance and the user comfort of buildings. The objective of this work is twofold: (1) To collect and present the state-of-the-art of commercially available smart windows from manufacturers, both adaptive and controllable products, i.e. thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic smart windows. This collection provides the reader with valuable information about window properties such as the U-value, g-value, solar transmittance (T-sol) and visible solar transmittance (T-vis). However, it is currently difficult to obtain all the desired information about the products from the manufacturers' websites and other open channels. (2) To conduct building energy performance simulations on selected products from each technology. These products are also simulated using the same U-values as the reference window, and in addition, two theoretical cases have been simulated to investigate the theoretical potential of different smart windows. Here, the optical parameters take on fictitious values between 10 and 90% and between 0 and 100% transmittance, respectively. All cases are simulated at three different locations, i.e. Trondheim (Norway), Madrid (Spain) and Nairobi (Kenya), and are compared to a reference static window. In total, 63 cases are simulated using the simulation software package IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE). The results shows that the electrochromic window controlled by operative temperature has the highest potential in lowering the energy demand for all cases and locations. The study also highlights the importance of having the right control strategy and control levels for each specific case.","[Tallberg, Rickard; Jelle, Bjorn Petter; Gao, Tao; Hamdy, Mohamed] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Jelle, Bjorn Petter] SINTEF Bldg & Infrastruct, Dept Mat & Struct, NO-7465 Trondheim, Norway; [Loonen, Roel] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Built Environm, Eindhoven, Netherlands",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Tallberg, R (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",rickard.tallberg@gmail.com,"Hamdy, Mohamed/Q-6228-2019; Hamdy, Mohamed S./B-5901-2014; Loonen, Roel/J-2751-2014; Hamdy, Mohamed S/AAO-9518-2020","Hamdy, Mohamed/0000-0002-3472-0386; Loonen, Roel/0000-0001-6101-1449; Hamdy, Mohamed S/0000-0002-7234-4924",Husbanken through the NTNU project Multi-Functional Building Envelopes - Visions for the Future,Husbanken through the NTNU project Multi-Functional Building Envelopes - Visions for the Future,"Valuable support and feedback on the work done in the software package IDA ICE has been provided by Bengt Hellstrom at Equa Simulation AB, especially concerning the creation of the control strategies and how to model smart windows in IDA ICE.

This problem is exacerbated by the presence of deicing agents that lead to reinforcement corrosion and overall concrete deterioration. Current research has mainly focused on studying the mechanical properties of concrete when exposed to cyclic conditions of freezing and thawing. Few studies have analyzed FTC's influence or the dual action of FTC and steel corrosion on the structural performance of RC. This paper surveys available literature on the synergistic effects of one or multiple environmental exposures on RC columns and methodologies for inducing frost damage according to current standards. The literature survey is organized as follows: (1) frost damage mechanism; (2) test methods to evaluate frost damage; (3) effect of FTC on concrete mechanical properties; (4) effect of FTC on the structural performance of RC columns; and (5) effect of dual action of FTC and steel corrosion on RC columns.

While the value of involving communities in risk management is increasingly accepted, the development of appropriate tools to support community engagement in flood risk management projects remains nascent. Using the Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments Program as a case study, the article interrogates the potential of citizen science to include disadvantaged urban communities in project-level flood risk reduction planning processes. This project collected more than 5,000 photos taken by 26 community members living in 13 informal settlements in Fiji and Indonesia between 2018 and 2020. The case study documents the method used as well as the results achieved within this two-year project. It discusses the method developed and implemented, outlines the main results, and provides lessons learned for others embarking on citizen science environmental-monitoring projects. The case study indicates that the engagement model and the technology used were key to the success of the flood-monitoring project. The experiences with the practice of monitoring floods in collaboration with communities in Fiji and Indonesia provide insights into how similar projects could advance more participatory risk management practices. The article identifies how this kind of approach can collect valuable flood data while also promoting opportunities for local communities to be heard in the arena of risk reduction and climate change adaptation.","[Wolff, Erich; Ramirez-Lovering, Diego] Monash Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [French, Matthew] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Ilhamsyah, Noor] Revitalising Informal Settlements & Their Environ, Bandung, Indonesia; [Sawailau, Mere Jane] Revitalising Informal Settlements & Their Environ, Suva, Fiji",Monash University; Monash University,"Wolff, E (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Fac Art Design & Architecture, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",erich.wolff@monash.edu; matthew.french@monash.edu; noorilhamsyah.rise@gmail.com; merejane.sawailau@livelearn.org; diego.ramirez@monash.edu,"Wolff, Erich/GOE-4190-2022","Wolff, Erich/0000-0001-7420-3546",Wellcome Trust (OPOH) [205222/Z/16/Z]; New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Asian Development Bank; Government of Fiji; City of Makassar; Monash University,Wellcome Trust (OPOH)(Wellcome Trust); New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); Asian Development Bank; Government of Fiji; City of Makassar; Monash University(Monash University),"The authors acknowledge the contributions of the colleagues within the RISE consortium, particularly the researchers and staff members involved in the flood-monitoring project in Fiji and Indonesia, including Isoa Vakarewa, Alex Wilson, Mosese Walesi, and Intan Putri, without which the flood-monitoring program here discussed would not have been possible.

Waste heat generation, infiltration, and leachate flow were the key variables evaluated in the modeling. The model results indicated that the average waste heat generation rates for this landfill ranged from 0.3 to 1.4 W/m(3). The higher heat generation rate corresponds to a relatively young (<= 4 years) portion of waste containing a relatively high mass fraction of coal combustion fly ash.

Similar to previous studies, removing mountains from both ESMs results in the winds becoming more zonal and weaker Indian and Asian monsoon circulations. However, there are also broad changes to the Walker circulation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Without orography, convection moves across the entire equatorial Indo-Pacific basin on interannual time scales. ENSO has a stronger amplitude, lower frequency, and increased regularity. A wider equatorial wind zone and changes to equatorial wind stress curl result in a colder cold tongue and a steeper equatorial thermocline across the Pacific basin during La Nina years. Anomalies associated with ENSO warm events are larger without mountains and have greater impact on the mean tropical climate than when mountains are present. Without mountains, the centennial-mean PacificWalker circulation weakens in both models by approximately 45%, but the strength of the mean Hadley circulation changes by less than 2%. Changes in the Walker circulation in these experiments can be explained by the large spatial excursions of atmospheric deep convection on interannual time scales. These results suggest that mountains are an important control on the large-scale tropical circulation, impacting ENSO dynamics and the Walker circulation, but have little impact on the strength of the Hadley circulation.","[Naiman, Zachary; Goodman, Paul J.; Russell, Joellen L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Krasting, John P.; Stouffer, Ronald J.; Wittenberg, Andrew T.] NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Malyshev, Sergey L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Arizona; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University,"Naiman, Z (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",znaiman@arizona.edu,"Malyshev, Sergey/N-6422-2019; Krasting, John/G-9360-2019; Wittenberg, Andrew T/G-9619-2013","Malyshev, Sergey/0000-0001-6259-1043; Krasting, John/0000-0002-4650-9844; Wittenberg, Andrew T/0000-0003-1680-8963; Goodman, Paul/0000-0002-1824-5845; Russell, Joellen/0000-0001-9937-6056; Naiman, Zachary/0000-0001-8359-1990",National Science Foundation (NSF) Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics and NSF [EAR-1338553]; Directorate For Geosciences [1246247] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF) Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics and NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics and NSF Grant EAR-1338553.

Despite this importance, state-of-the-art climate models show a large SST warm bias in this region. Knowledge about the seasonal mixed layer (ML) heat budget is a prerequisite for understanding SST mean state and its variability. Within this study all contributions to the seasonal ML heat budget are estimated at four locations within the Atlantic cold tongue (ACT) that are representative for the western (0 degrees N, 23 degrees W), central (0 degrees N, 10 degrees W) and eastern (0 degrees N, 0 degrees E) equatorial as well as the southern (10 degrees S, 10 degrees W) ACT. To estimate the contribution of the diapycnal heat flux due to turbulence an extensive data set of microstructure observations collected during ten research cruises between 2005 and 2012 is analyzed. The results for the equatorial ACT indicate that with the inclusion of the diapycnal heat flux the seasonal ML heat budget is balanced. Within the equatorial region, the diapycnal heat flux is essential for the development of the ACT. It dominates over all other cooling terms in the central and eastern equatorial ACT, while it is of similar size as the zonal advection in the western equatorial ACT. In contrast, the SST evolution in the southern ACT region can be explained entirely by air-sea heat fluxes.","[Hummels, Rebecca; Dengler, Marcus; Brandt, Peter; Schlundt, Michael] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel,"Hummels, R (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",rhummels@geomar.de,"Brandt, Peter/C-8254-2013; Dengler, Marcus/A-7327-2014; Hummels, Rebecca/A-3631-2015; Schlundt, Michael/AAW-3542-2020","Brandt, Peter/0000-0002-9235-955X; Dengler, Marcus/0000-0001-5993-9088; Hummels, Rebecca/0000-0002-3746-6213; Schlundt, Michael/0000-0003-4462-8230",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft as part of the Emmy Noether Program [DE1369/1-1]; PREFACE Project [603521]; European Union [284321]; Climate-Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean [Sonderforschungsbereich 754]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung as part of the Verbundvorhaben NORDATLANTIK [03F0443B],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft as part of the Emmy Noether Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)); PREFACE Project; European Union(European Commission); Climate-Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung as part of the Verbundvorhaben NORDATLANTIK(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors thank Bernard Bourles for the cooperation during the EGEE field campaign.

By elaborating Hannah Arendt's notion of 'earth alienation' and Bruno Latour's notion of technology as 'missing mass', we suggest that, in the current Anthropocene era, our relation to technology should be a crucial theme of CCE and EE. We further suspect that sustainable development (SD) and the education promoting it (ESD) are problematic, because the green growth proposed is inextricably linked to the unattainable goal of decoupling growth from environmental impact. We therefore suggest education for post-sustainability (EPS) that critically re-evaluates the connections between technology and sustainability. But can educators critically question technology, since educational institutions seem to be unconditionally committed to promoting technological progress? While tracing this professional dilemma, we call for educational responsibility and autonomy to question technology when it is at odds with sustainability. To this end, we outline technological literacy that introduces the arts of (a) seeing technology, (b) living with technology, and (c) delegating or sustainably assimilating technology.","[Takkinen, Pasi; Pulkki, Jani] Tampere Univ, Fac Educ & Culture, Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Takkinen, P (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Educ & Culture, Tampere, Finland.",pasi.takkinen@tuni.fi,,"Takkinen, Pasi/0000-0002-2583-981X; Pulkki, Jani/0000-0001-7058-5364",Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation [202100031]; Kone Foundation [201801313],Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Kone Foundation,This work was supported by Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation under Grant 202100031 and Kone Foundation under Grant 201801313.,,58,0,0,4,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1857,1469-5812,,EDUC PHILOS THEORY,Educ.

We also show how these irrigation practices, combined with more sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices, can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wine grapes cultivation and make irrigated Mediterranean vineyards more resilient and sustainable. We analyse the deficit irrigation (DI) strategies used most often for different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions. We review the latest advances in the application of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and partial root zone drying irrigation (PRI) strategies in grapevines (red and white grapes), as well as other irrigation methods used less frequently in vineyards to improve WUEyield, berry quality and irrigation efficiency, such as subsurface drip irrigation. We also analyze recent findings concerning the physiological response of the vine to water stress with more holistic approaches such as, hydraulic safety marging and stress distance, and discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of RDI management in field conditions, according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety/rootstock combination. We review optimum vine water status ranges and the thresholds proposed for better deficit irrigation scheduling in vineyards. In addition, we consider sustainable soil management practices - such as cover crops, mulching, composting, reduced tillage, mutualistic plant-microorganisms interactions, and agroforestry - and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve WUE, soil/vine performance, and other ecological services in RDI vineyards within a more sustainable farming system (organic farming). The idea is to design sustainable and climate-change-resilient agricultural systems (e.g. vineyards) in Mediterranean semi-arid areas.","[Romero, Pascual; Navarro, Josefa Maria; Ordaz, Pablo Botia] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Medioambi, Irrigat & Stress Physiol Grp, C Mayor S-N, Murcia 30150, Spain",,"Romero, P (corresponding author), Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Medioambi, Irrigat & Stress Physiol Grp, C Mayor S-N, Murcia 30150, Spain.",pascual.romero@carm.es,,"BOTIA ORDAZ, PABLO/0000-0002-3646-3264","Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Spain) [RTA2005-00103-00-00, RTA2008-00037-C04-04, RTA2012-00105-00-00, FEDER PO-07-033, FEDER 1420-13, FEDER 1420-24]; European Social Fund; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades within the program Challenges of Society [I+D+I AGL2017-83738-C3-2-R]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)","Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Spain)(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades within the program Challenges of Society; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)(European Commission)","This work was financed by the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Spain), Subprograma Nacional de Recursos y Tecnologias Agrarias en coordinacion con las comunidades autonomas, through the projects RTA2005-00103-00-00, RTA2008-00037-C04-04 and RTA2012-00105-00-00, through the projects FEDER PO-07-033, FEDER 1420-13 and FEDER 1420-24, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) and the European Social Fund, and through the project I+D+I AGL2017-83738-C3-2-R, financed by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades within the program Challenges of Society.

Four series of numerical experiments were conducted (one control experiment and three forest fire experiments assuming total vegetation destruction within the burned areas) to evaluate possible effects of forest fires on surface albedo and vegetation properties as well as their influence on air chemistry and aerosol concentration in the atmosphere. The modeling results showed significant influence of forest fires on regional weather conditions that occurred over large areas situated even away from burnt regions. Decreased surface albedo and reduced latent heat fluxes due to fire-induced destruction of forest cover lead to higher near-surface air temperature and lower air humidity in both burned and surrounding unburned forest areas. On the other hand, reduced incoming solar radiation due to smoke from forest fire plumes decreased land surface temperatures and increased thermal atmospheric stability resulting in reduced regional precipitation.","[Kirsanov, Alexander; Rozinkina, Inna; Rivin, Gdaliy; Zakharchenko, Denis] Hydrometeorol Res Ctr Russian Federat, Bolshoi Predtechenskiy Per 11-13, Moscow 123242, Russia; [Kirsanov, Alexander] Russian Acad Sci, Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Pyzhyovskiy Per 3, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Rivin, Gdaliy; Zakharchenko, Denis; Olchev, Alexander] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, GSP-1, Moscow 119991, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Olchev, A (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, GSP-1, Moscow 119991, Russia.",heu3becteh@mail.ru; inna.rozinkina@mail.ru; gdaly.rivin@mail.ru; dozentmi7@mail.ru; aoltche@gmail.com,"Zakharchenko, Denis/AAY-6558-2021; Olchev, Alexander/A-5079-2016","Olchev, Alexander/0000-0002-6144-5826",Russian Science Foundation [16-17-10275]; Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring [AAAA-A20-120021490079-3]; Lomonosov Moscow State University [AAAA-A16-116032810086-4],Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"=Algorithms to assess the vertical profiles of atmospheric pollutant concentrations were developed by A.K. with support by the grant of the Russian Science Foundation 16-17-10275.

The multiweek and seasonal performance of ACCESS-S1 has been evaluated based on a 23-year hindcast set and compared to the current operational system, POAMA. The system has considerable enhancements compared to POAMA, including higher vertical and horizontal resolution of the component models and state-ofthe-art physics parameterisation schemes. ACCESS-S1 is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system, but has enhancements to the ensemble generation strategy to make it appropriate for multi-week forecasting, and a larger ensemble size. ACCESS-S1 has markedly reduced biases in the mean state of the climate, both globally and over Australia, compared to POAMA. ACCESS-S1 also better predicts the early stages of the development of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (through the predictability barrier) and the Indian Ocean Dipole, as well as multi-week variations of the Southern Annular Mode and the Madden-Julian Oscillation - all important drivers of Australian climate variability. There is an overall improvement in the skill of the forecasts of rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) over Australia on multi-week timescales compared to POAMA. On seasonal timescales the differences between the two systems are generally less marked. ACCESS-S1 has improved seasonal forecasts over Australia for the austral spring season compared to POAMA, with particularly good forecast reliability for rainfall and Tmax. However, forecasts of seasonal mean Tmax are noticeably less skilful over eastern Australia for forecasts of late autumn and winter compared to POAMA. The study has identified scope for improvement of ACCESS-S in the future, particularly 1) reducing rainfall errors in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent regions, and 2) initialising the land surface with realistic soil moisture rather than climatology. The latter impacts negatively on the skill of the temperature forecasts over eastern Australia and is being addressed in the next version of the system, ACCESS-S2.","[Hudson, Debra; Alves, Oscar; Hendon, Harry H.; Lim, Eun-Pa; Liu, Guoqiang; Luo, Jing-Jia; Marshall, Andrew G.; Shi, Li; Wang, Guomin; Wedd, Robin; Young, Griffith; Zhao, Mei; Zhou, Xiaobing] Bur Meteorol, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [MacLachlan, Craig] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Hudson, D (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",debra.hudson@bom.gov.au,"Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019","Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638",Australian Government through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper; Managing Climate Variability Program [MCV00041]; Victorian Climate Initiative; Australian Government,Australian Government through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper(Australian Government); Managing Climate Variability Program; Victorian Climate Initiative; Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR),"Support for this work was provided by the Australian Government through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, which established a roadmap of practical actions to grow the agriculture sector in Australia, as well as by the Managing Climate Variability Program (MCV00041) and the Victorian Climate Initiative.

It is visited by ca. 2 million people annually. Granada is situated in a natural basin, surrounded by mountains with altitudes up to 3500 m. Due to this topography and the prevailing low wind speeds, pollution-derived and especially traffic-derived particulate matter often accumulates in the urban air. In order to evaluate the potential conservation risks from the surrounding air, the atmospheric composition in the Alhambra monument was evaluated. Indoor temperature and relative humidity fluctuations were evaluated for their potential degenerative effects. Furthermore, the atmospheric composition in the Alhambra was analyzed in terms of inorganic gases (NO2, SO2, O-3, and NH3) and black carbon. It was found that the open architecture protected the indoor environments from developing a potentially harmful microclimate, such as the build-up of humidity resulting from the huge number of daily tourists. On the downside, the strong ventilation made the indoor air hardly different from outdoor air, as characterized by strong diurnal temperature and relative humidity gradients and high traffic-derived pollutant levels.","[Horemans, B.; Schalm, O.; De Wael, K.; Van Grieken, R.] Univ Antwerp, Univ Pl 1, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Horemans, B (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Univ Pl 1, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",benjamin.horemans@ua.ac.be,"Cardell-Fernández, Carolina/D-2075-2009; De Wael, Karolien/U-5545-2018; Horemans, Benjamin/E-2908-2016; Schalm, Olivier/AAV-5757-2021","Cardell-Fernández, Carolina/0000-0001-6771-0195; Horemans, Benjamin/0000-0002-6532-591X; Schalm, Olivier/0000-0001-8705-7293; De Wael, Karolien/0000-0003-4495-0748; Horemans, Benjamin/0000-0003-1950-8106",,,,,29,1,1,1,23,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1757-8981,,,IOP CONF SER-MAT SCI,,,2012,,,,,,,12002,10.1088/1757-899X/37/1/012002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/37/1/012002,,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Materials Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Physics,BBO10,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,12/21/22,WOS:000307662000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, cluster analysis is used to investigate El Nino diversity in 30 CMIP5 models. As the method does not rely on any prior knowledge of the patterns of El Nino seen in observations, it provides a practical way to identify the degree of El Nino diversity in models. Under the historical scenario, most models show a poor degree of El Nino diversity in their own model world, primarily due to the lopsided numbers of events belonging to the two modeled El Nino types and the weak compactness of events in each cluster. Four models are found showing significant El Nino diversity, yet none of them captures the longitudinal distributions of the warming centers of the two El Nino types seen in the observations. Heat budget analysis of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly suggests that the degree of modeled El Nino diversity is highly related to the climatological zonal SST gradient over the western-central equatorial Pacific in models. As the gradient is weakened in most models under the future high-emission scenario, the degree of modeled El Nino diversity is further reduced in the future. The results indicate that a better simulation of the SST gradient over the western-central equatorial Pacific might allow a more reliable simulation/projection of El Nino diversity in most CMIP5 models.","[Feng, Jie; Lian, Tao; Ying, Jun; Li, Junde] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lian, Tao] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Gen] Hohai Univ, Coll Oceanog, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Hohai University,"Lian, T (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Lian, T (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",liantao@sio.org.cn,,"Feng, Jie/0000-0001-5349-7688; li, junde/0000-0003-4926-0543; li, junde/0000-0003-1839-8988","National Program on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-IPOVAI-04]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41690121, 41690120, 41621064]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LR19D060001]",National Program on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"The HadISST1 dataset is from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/and the NCEP-GODAS dataset is from https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/.

These installations are usually performed by technicians and not by conservators. Conventional installation procedures cannot be carried out without damages to sensitive original surfaces when the sensors are removed later. The aim of this cooperation between building physicists and conservators is to develop a system, where neither substance losses occur nor unwanted residues with unknown aging behavior remain after dismantling the installation and which does not affect the measurement results significantly.

Existing global flood risk projections fail to integrate the combined dynamics of expected socio-economic development and climate change. We present the first global future river flood risk projections that separate the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development. The projections are based on an ensemble of climate model outputs(2), socio-economic scenarios(3), and a state-of-the-art hydrologic river flood model combined with socio-economic impact models(4,5). Globally, absolute damage may increase by up to a factor of 20 by the end of the century without action. Countries in Southeast Asia face a severe increase in flood risk. Although climate change contributes significantly to the increase in risk in Southeast Asia(6), we show that it is dwarfed by the effect of socio-economic growth, even after normalization for gross domestic product (GDP) growth. African countries face a strong increase in risk mainly due to socio-economic change. However, when normalized to GDP, climate change becomes by far the strongest driver.

The 26 papers in the current special issue of the 12th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems represent a pursuit of excellence for leading related advancements. This editorial contains a review of these advances with a focus on the themes of effective valorisation of bioenergy resources, energy-water nexus in wastewater treatment processes, optimized local energy supply for efficient and clean systems, solar energy technologies for the energy transition, and technologies for efficient combustion and electric transport. Other themes are alternative and cross-cutting technologies for the energy system in addition to analyses of thermal energy recovery and heat transfer. Significant contributions under these themes relate to biomass residues and biogas upgrading processes, novel renewable energy and performance comparisons in the wastewater sector, efficient micro-cogeneration, polygeneration and load sharing approaches, clustering techniques in district heating networks as well as hybrid and concentrated solar power systems. Control strategies for latent energy storage, aging processes in battery packs, engine knock occurrence and coupled numerical engine modelling, fuel blends with nanoparticle additives, utilization of flue gas, soot formation in plastic waste pyrolysis, high altitude wind energy systems as well as exergy analyses for heat and cold recovery and reverse electrodialysis are other key contributions. The advances are expected to enable more sustainable energy conversion and management processes in a time when an integrated approach is nothing less than essential to maintain a coherent and liveable Planet.","[Kilkis, Siir] Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey, Ataturk Bulvari 221, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Krajacic, Goran; Duic, Neven] Univ Zagreb, Fac Mech Engn & Naval Architecture, Ivana Lucica 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Rosen, Marc A.] Univ Ontario Inst Technol, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Oshawa, ON L1H 7K4, Canada; [Al-Nimr, Moh'd Ahmad] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Mech Engn Dept, Ar Ramtha 3030, Irbid 22110, Jordan",Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK); University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering & Naval Architecture; Ontario Tech University; Jordan University of Science & Technology,"Kilkis, S (corresponding author), Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey, Ataturk Bulvari 221, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",Siir.Kilkis@tubitak.gov.tr; Goran.Krajacic@fsb.hr; Neven.Duic@fsb.hr; Marc.Rosen@uoit.ca; Malnimr@just.edu.jo,"Duić, Neven/J-5242-2012; Kilkis, Siir/E-5934-2015; Krajačić, Goran/K-9310-2018","Duić, Neven/0000-0003-2376-6466; Kilkis, Siir/0000-0003-3466-3593; Krajačić, Goran/0000-0003-4481-8288","Combustion Institute - Adria Section, Zagreb, Croatia; Croatian and Slovenian Association for the Club of Rome; Club of Rome - European Research Centre, Konstanz; Mediterranean Network for Engineering Schools and Technical Universities (RMEI); World Academy of Art and Science","Combustion Institute - Adria Section, Zagreb, Croatia; Croatian and Slovenian Association for the Club of Rome; Club of Rome - European Research Centre, Konstanz; Mediterranean Network for Engineering Schools and Technical Universities (RMEI); World Academy of Art and Science","The organizers were further supported by partners including:; The Combustion Institute - Adria Section, Zagreb, Croatia; Croatian and Slovenian Association for the Club of Rome; Club of Rome - European Research Centre, Konstanz; Mediterranean Network for Engineering Schools and Technical Universities (RMEI); The World Academy of Art and Science",,188,47,47,7,126,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0196-8904,1879-2227,,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

The sensitivities of precipitation and other related meteorological variables to 11 selected parameters in the new Kain-Fritsch Scheme, WRF Single-Moment 6-class Scheme, and Yonsei University Scheme are then investigated. The results demonstrate that (1) the Morris method is effective and efficient for screening important parameters qualitatively, and with recommended settings of levels p = 8 and replication times r = 10 only 10 x (D + 1) WRF runs are required, where D is the dimension of parameter space; (2) Gaussian process regression (GP) is the best method for constructing surrogates, and the GP-based Sobol' method can provide reliable quantitative results for sensitivity analysis when the number of WRF runs exceeds 200; and (3) the sensitivity index in the Morris method is closely related to the Sobol' index S-T, and even for qualitative sensitivity analysis, the GP-based Sobol' method is more efficient compared to the Morris method. The SA results show that larger values of the downdraft-related parameter x(1), entrainment-related parameter x(2), and downdraft starting height x(3) significantly decrease rainfall, while the maximum allowed value for the cloud ice diameter x(6) has a moderate decreasing effect on precipitation.

One particular issue is the representation of the extensive and persistent low-level clouds over southern West Africa (SWA) during boreal summer. These clouds are important in regulating the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface, but their role in the local energy balance and the overall monsoon system has never been assessed. Based on sensitivity experiments using the ICON model for July 2006, we show for the first time that rainfall over SWA depends logarithmically on the optical thickness of low clouds, as these control the diurnal evolution of the planetary boundary layer, vertical stability and finally convection. In our experiments, the increased precipitation over SWA has a small direct effect on the downstream Sahel, as higher temperatures due to increased surface radiation are accompanied by decreases in low-level moisture due to changes in advection, leading to almost unchanged equivalent potential temperatures in the Sahel. A systematic comparison of simulations with and without convective parameterization reveals agreement in the direction of the precipitation signal but larger sensitivity for explicit convection. For parameterized convection the main rainband is too far south and the diurnal cycle shows signs of unrealistic vertical mixing, leading to a positive feedback on low clouds. The results demonstrate that relatively minor errors, variations or trends in low-level cloudiness over SWA can have substantial impacts on precipitation. Similarly, they suggest that the dimming likely associated with an increase in anthropogenic emissions in the future would lead to a decrease in summer rainfall in the densely populated Guinea coastal area. Future work should investigate longer-term effects of the misrepresentation of low clouds in climate models, e.g. moderated through effects on rainfall, soil moisture and evaporation.","[Kniffka, Anke; Knippertz, Peter; Fink, Andreas H.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Kniffka, A (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany.",anke.kniffka@kit.edu,"Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Fink, Andreas H./F-3024-2017","Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Fink, Andreas H./0000-0002-5840-2120","European Union [603502]; BMBF project IMPETUS [01LW06001A, 313-21200200]",European Union(European Commission); BMBF project IMPETUS(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The research presented in this article has received funding from the European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement 603502 (EU project DACCIWA: Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions inWest Africa).

Light control was implemented through the use of darker paint finishes on the walls and ceiling, which reduced the amount of reflected light reaching Hambletonian; and the addition of a mesh screen to the outside of the glazed dome above the painting.

In other words, between two artistic created holes, Untitled (Silueta Series, La Ventosa, Mexico) 1976 and Munich Depression, 1969 created by Ana Mendieta and Michael Heizer respectively, and the 'wholes' of which they are a part. These musings on holes are composed through three morphologies; volumes, horizons or edges, and surfaces. Through experiences of these holes (at the time of their making and since) an environmental imaginary is forwarded, marked, I argue by intimate geologies that reframe the temporal and spatial scales of the geologies that more usually mark Anthropocene imaginaries. The first tension explored is that between the two artist holes and the Whole Earth images of the same era. I am concerned with the tensions between the planetary scale environmental imaginaries of these images and those forwarded by the holes. The second and third tensions explore gaps in the recreations and records of the 'original' landscape-based holes. Ideas of horizon and edge, and of surface offer the means to reflect on the thematisation of loss and on ongoingness, such that what is brought into view is both the ungraspability of the horizons over which our environmental imaginations need to operate, but also an inevitable ongoingness of geological and geomorphological processes. As such, through each morphological discussion the nothing-ness of these holes composes intimate geologies which sit in tension with those `geos' long associated with the planetarity of Whole Earth images.","[Hawkins, Harriet] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, London, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Hawkins, H (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Geog, London, England.",Harriet.hawkins@rhul.ac.uk,,,UK AHRC [AH/N004132/1]; Phillip Leverhulme Prize [PLP-2016-186]; AHRC [AH/N004132/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Phillip Leverhulme Prize; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This article was supported by field work and research time funded by a research grant from the UK AHRC (AH/N004132/1) and the Phillip Leverhulme Prize (PLP-2016-186).,,74,5,6,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-4586,1878-0040,,EMOT SPACE SOC,Emot.

The multi-week and seasonal performance of ACCESS-S1 has been evaluated based on a 23-year hindcast set and compared to the current operational system, POAMA. The system has considerable enhancements compared to POAMA, including higher vertical and horizontal resolution of the component models and state-of-the-art physics parameterisation schemes. ACCESS-S1 is based on the UK Met Office GloSea5-GC2 seasonal prediction system, but has enhancements to the ensemble generation strategy to make it appropriate for multi-week forecasting, and a larger ensemble size. ACCESS-S1 has markedly reduced biases in the mean state of the climate, both globally and over Australia, compared to POAMA. ACCESS-S1 also better predicts the early stages of the development of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (through the predictability barrier) and the Indian Ocean Dipole, as well as multi-week variations of the Southern Annular Mode and the Madden-Julian Oscillation - all important drivers of Australian climate variability. There is an overall improvement in the skill of the forecasts of rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) over Australia on multi-week timescales compared to POAMA. On seasonal timescales the differences between the two systems are generally less marked. ACCESS-S1 has improved seasonal forecasts over Australia for the austral spring season compared to POAMA, with particularly good forecast reliability for rainfall and Tmax. However, forecasts of seasonal mean Tmax are noticeably less skilful over eastern Australia for forecasts of late autumn and winter compared to POAMA. The study has identified scope for improvement of ACCESS-S in the future, particularly 1) reducing rainfall errors in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent regions, and 2) initialising the land surface with realistic soil moisture rather than climatology. The latter impacts negatively on the skill of the temperature forecasts over eastern Australia and is being addressed in the next version of the system, ACCESS-S2.","[Hudson, Debra; Alves, Oscar; Hendon, Harry H.; Lim, Eun-Pa; Liu, Guoqiang; Luo, Jing-Jia; Marshall, Andrew G.; Shi, Li; Wang, Guomin; Wedd, Robin; Young, Griffith; Zhao, Mei; Zhou, Xiaobing] Bur Meteorol, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [MacLachlan, Craig] Hadley Ctr, Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England",Bureau of Meteorology - Australia; Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre,"Hudson, D (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",debra.hudson@bom.gov.au,"Luo, Jing-Jia/T-9612-2019","Luo, Jing-Jia/0000-0003-2181-0638; Hudson, Debra/0000-0002-0129-0922",Australian Government through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper; Managing Climate Variability Program [MCV00041]; Victorian Climate Initiative; Australian Government,Australian Government through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper(Australian Government); Managing Climate Variability Program; Victorian Climate Initiative; Australian Government(Australian GovernmentCGIAR),"Support for this work was provided by the Australian Government through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, which established a roadmap of practical actions to grow the agriculture sector in Australia, as well as by the Managing Climate Variability Program (MCV00041) and the Victorian Climate Initiative.

In most of countries, e.g. The German government planned to install 25000MW of offshore wind fauns by 2030. The greater part of offshore wind fauns are integrated with High Voltage AC (HVAC) transmission to the onshore grid. Offshore wind fauns are integrated with High Voltage DC (HVDC) transmission for long distances (>50km) to the grid because of capacitive cable current in HVAC. The major challenge in HVDC transmission is the installation, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Voltage Sourced Converter (VSC) HVDC substation in the offshore climate. Currently, in case offshore wind faun the research have been fastened to reduce the complexity with increasing reliability and minimizing cost. This paper gives a comprehensive review of integration of offshore wind faun via Low Frequency AC or Fractional Frequency AC (LFAC or FFAC) transmission. LFAC transmission is adopted from HVAC and it is operated at one third of nominal frequency (16.67 Hz). As compared to HVDC the main advantage of LFAC is an absence of the offshore converter station, hence system complexity and cost reduced. In design considerations, especially the offshore transformer is one of the challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive review on components and its design considerations of offshore novel LFAC transmission. The offshore wind turbine considerations, collector network and different types of onshore frequency converters explained in detail.","[Chaithanya, Seetha; Kiranmayi, R.] Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ Anantapur, Dept Elect Engn, Anantapuramu, AP, India; [Reddy, V.

Taking into account that the expected economic growth of developing countries will inevitably be accompanied by a further growth in emissions in these countries, there is a strong necessity that the energy systems in the industrialized world be transformed into emission-free ones. This level of reduction requires, for example, that the European Union achieves a 'nearly zero-carbon power supply', involving replacing of fossil fuels in most or all buildings and much of the transport sector by nearly zero-carbon electricity. It is also clear that the current political framework is, especially in Europe, propitiating the large-scale implementation of renewable energy sources. In order to make this large implementation economically feasible, it is essential that the potential of these sources is maximized, placing them at sites providing the highest possible output. These sites are often located far away from consumption centers, making compulsory the transmission of large amounts of energy from generation to demand. In the global scenario, the necessary capacity of the power infrastructure for doing such exceeds by far the existing infrastructure and therefore new transmission capacity is necessary. Taking into account that large amounts of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are to be integrated in the current power system and that most of the generation will take place at remote locations requiring new transmission assets, this article answers the question of whether a supergrid is necessary to enable this transformation.

We investigated the potentiality of identifying the distribution, richness and hot-spots of threatened plant species at a 25 ha resolution using eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, MARS, ANN, CTA, GBM, MDA and RF) in a taiga landscape in north-eastern Finland. First, the individual species models developed based on occurrence records of 28 species in the 1677 grid squares and derived from different statistical techniques were extrapolated to the whole study area of 41 750 km(2). Second, the projected presence/absence maps were then combined to create species richness maps, and the top 5% of grid cells ranked by species richness were classified as hotspots. Finally, we created an overall summary map by combining the individual hotspot maps from all eight modelling techniques and identified areas where the individual hotspots maps overlapped most. There were distinguishing differences in projections of the geographic patterns of species richness and hotspots between the modelling techniques. Most of the modelling techniques predicted several hotspot locations sporadically around the study area. However, the overall summary map showed the highest predictive performance based on Kappa statistics, indicating that the locations where the hotspot maps from the eight models coincided most harboured highest observed species richness. Moreover, the summary map filtered out the patchy structures of individual hotspot maps. The results show that the choice of modelling technique may affect the accuracy and prediction of hotspot patterns. Such differences may hamper the development of useful biodiversity model applications for conservation planning, and thus it is beneficial if the conservation decision-making can be based on sets of alternative maps and overlaying of predictions from multiple models.

Physical theory of cyclogenesis is limited, observational datasets suffer from heterogeneities in space and time, and state-of-the-art climate models used for future projections are still too coarse (similar to 100 km of resolution) to simulate realistic systems. Two approaches can nevertheless be considered: 1) perform dedicated high-resolution (typically <50 km) experiments in which tropical cyclones can be tracked and 2) assess cyclone activity from existing low-resolution multimodel climate projections using large-scale indices as proxies. Here we explore these two approaches with a particular focus on the southern Indian Ocean. We first compute high-resolution experiments using the rotated-stretched configuration of our climate model (CNRM-CM6-1), which is able to simulate realistic tropical cyclones. In a 2-K warmer world, the model projects a 20% decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones, together with an increase in their maximum lifetime intensity, a slight poleward shift of their trajectories, and a substantial delay (about 1 month) in the cyclone season onset. Large-scale indices applied to these high-resolution experiments fail to capture the overall decrease in cyclone frequency, but are able to partially represent projected changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of cyclone activity. Last, we apply large-scale indices to multimodel CMIP5 projections and find that the seasonal redistribution of cyclone activity is consistent across models.","[Cattiaux, Julien; Chauvin, Fabrice] Univ Toulouse, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, CNRS, Meteo France, Toulouse, France; [Bousquet, Olivier; Malardel, Sylvie; Tsai, Chia-Lun] Univ Reunion, Lab Atmosphere & Cyclones, CNRS, Meteo France, St Denis, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of La Reunion,"Cattiaux, J (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, CNRS, Meteo France, Toulouse, France.",julien.cattiaux@meteo.fr,"Tsai, Chia-Lun/AHI-4361-2022","Tsai, Chia-Lun/0000-0002-7669-0920; Cattiaux, Julien/0000-0001-8630-5574; Malardel, Sylvie/0000-0001-8205-0666",ReNovRisk-C3 project within the Indian Ocean INTERREG-V Programme 2014-20,ReNovRisk-C3 project within the Indian Ocean INTERREG-V Programme 2014-20,"This work has been partly supported by the ReNovRisk-C3 project within the Indian Ocean INTERREG-V Programme 2014-20.

Here, we estimated the BEC values of a highly performing biomonitor, the epiphytic lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea, by means of a careful review of literature data, integrated by an extensive field survey. Methodologically homogeneous element content datasets, reflecting different exposure conditions across European and extra-European countries, were compiled and comparatively analysed. Element content in samples collected in remote areas was compared to that of potentially enriched samples, testing differences between medians for 25 elements. This analysis confirmed that the former samples were substantially unaffected by anthropogenic contributions, and their metrics were therefore proposed as a first overview at supra-national background level. We also showed that bioaccumulation studies suffer a huge methodological variability. Limited to original field data, we investigated the background variability of 43 elements in 62 remote Italian sites, characterized in GIS environment for anthropization, land use, climate and lithology at different scale resolution. The relationships between selected environmental descriptors and BEC were tested using Principal Component Regression (PCR) modelling. Elemental composition resulted significantly dependent on land use, climate and lithology. In the case of lithogenic elements, regression models correctly reproduced the lichen content throughout the country at randomly selected sites. Further descriptors should be identified only for As, Co, and V. Through a multivariate approach we also identified three geographically homogeneous macro-regions for which specific BECs were provided for use as reference in biomonitoring applications.

The models and satellite observations are compared in the form of the statistics obtained from combined analysis of multiple-satellite observables that probe signatures of the cloud-to-precipitation transition process. One common problem identified among these models is the too-frequent occurrence of warm precipitation. The precipitation is found to form when the cloud particle size and the liquid water path (LWP) are both much smaller than those in observations. The too-efficient formation of precipitation is found to be compensated for by errors of cloud microphysical properties, such as underestimated cloud particle size and LWP, to an extent that varies among the models. However, this does not completely cancel the precipitation formation bias. Robust errors are also found in the evolution of cloud microphysical properties from nonprecipitating to drizzling and then to raining clouds in some GCMs, implying unrealistic interaction between precipitation and cloud water. Nevertheless, auspicious information is found for future improvement of warm precipitation representations: the adoption of more realistic autoconversion scheme in the high-resolution model improves the triggering of precipitation, and the introduction of a sophisticated subgrid variability scheme in a traditional model improves the simulated precipitation frequency over subtropical eastern ocean. However, deterioration in other warm precipitation characteristics is also found accompanying these improvements, implying the multisource nature of warm precipitation biases in GCMs.","[Jing, Xianwen; Suzuki, Kentaroh] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Guo, Huan] NOAA, UCAR CPAESS, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Goto, Daisuke; Ogura, Tomoo] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Koshiro, Tsuyoshi] Japan Meteorol Agcy, Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Muelmenstaedt, Johannes] Univ Leipzig, Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany",University of Tokyo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Japan Meteorological Agency; Meteorological Research Institute - Japan; Leipzig University,"Jing, XW; Suzuki, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.",jing_xw@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp; ksuzuki@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Jing, Xianwen/K-3868-2019; Goto, Daisuke/A-2538-2016; Suzuki, Kentaroh/C-3624-2011; Guo, Huan/D-8282-2014; Koshiro, Tsuyoshi/AGL-8595-2022; 小倉, 知夫/I-3502-2018; Muelmenstaedt, Johannes/K-2432-2015","Jing, Xianwen/0000-0003-0698-4971; Goto, Daisuke/0000-0003-2975-3738; Guo, Huan/0000-0002-8312-9963; Koshiro, Tsuyoshi/0000-0003-2971-7446; Muelmenstaedt, Johannes/0000-0003-1105-6678; Suzuki, Kentaroh/0000-0001-5315-2452","NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections program [NA15OAR4310153]; JAXA GCOM-C project; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections program; JAXA GCOM-C project; Integrated Research Program for Advancing Climate Models (TOUGOU program) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","This study was supported by NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections program with the grant NA15OAR4310153 and JAXA GCOM-C project.

Further, not directly dated animal species can be in- or excluded after examining the find contexts of the archaeological excavations in which most of the bones were discovered. In addition, the depiction of (human) mobiliary art can be considered. It becomes clear that in the period 16,000-15,000 cal BP a Late Magdalenian appeared with tundral and steppe species. In contrast, the period 15,000-14,000 cal BP cannot be exactly described as find complexes are missing and biostrategraphies and radiometric metering are indistinct. However, the beginning of the Late Palaeolithic from about 14,000 cal BP is obvious and associated with large animal species in arboreous habitats. Again, the following period which reaches up to the Early Holocene, can only vaguely be understood due to insufficient data and few archaeological excavations. The existence of horses in Central Germany can be shown continuously from the Late Weichselian Glacial up to the Early Holocene.","[Pasda, Clemens; Pfeifer, Sebastian] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Orientalist Indogermanist Ur & Fruhgeschicht, Seminar Ur & Fruhgeschichtl Archaol, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Pasda, C (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Orientalist Indogermanist Ur & Fruhgeschicht, Seminar Ur & Fruhgeschichtl Archaol, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",clemens.pasda@uni-jena.de; sebastian.pfeifer@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,105,4,4,0,0,ROMISCH-GERMANISCHES ZENTRALMUSEUM,MAINZ,"ERNST-LUDWIG-PLATZ 2, MAINZ, 55116, GERMANY",0342-734X,,,ARCHAOL KORRESPONDEN,Archaol.

Though all the models can be tuned to Simulate current-day conditions to some degree of accuracy the responses of each model to perturbations in forcing from the atmosphere or ocean are different. Thus, climate-change prediction depends on the choice of sea-ice model. In this study, the sensitivities of various sea-ice models to external heat-flux: perturbations are examined in a systematic manner. Starting from similar baseline annual thicknesses, each model is subjected to an applied heat-flux perturbation to assess icemelt. Separate experiments are conducted to compare the response of each model to heat fluxes applied at the atmospheric and the oceanic interfaces. It is found that the magnitude of the heat-flux perturbation required to melt ice varies greatly among-different models, with the largest difference arising between models that include ice dynamics vs those that do not. Most models show art asymmetry in the response to heat-flux perturbations applied at the top and bottom surfaces of the ice. This study has implications for the choice of sea-ice models used for climate-change simulations. Ii also gives insight to the accuracy required for observations and model simulations of the surface heat fluxes.","Univ Colorado, Dept Aerosp Engn Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Arbetter, TE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Aerosp Engn Sci, Campus Box 429, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,0,7,7,0,1,INT GLACIOLOGICAL SOC,CAMBRIDGE,"LENSFIELD RD, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1ER, ENGLAND",0260-3055,,0-946417-20-2,ANN GLACIOL,,,1997,,,,,193,197,,10.3189/S0260305500014026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/S0260305500014026,,,3,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,BK58K,,Bronze,,,12/21/22,WOS:000072623800034,View Full Record in Web of Science

CFSv2 demonstrates high skill in reproducing the spatial distribution of the observed climatological mean summer monsoon precipitation along with its interannual variability, a task which has been a conundrum for many recent climate coupled models. The model also exhibits reasonable skill in simulating coherent northward propagating monsoon intraseasonal anomalies including SST and precipitation, which are generally consistent with observed ISV characteristics. Results from the observations and the model establish the existence of spatial variability in the atmospheric convective response to SST anomalies, over the Asian monsoon domain on intraseasonal timescales. The response is fast over the Arabian Sea, where precipitation lags SST by similar to 5 days; whereas it is slow over the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea, with a lag of similar to 12 days. The intraseasonal SST anomalies result in a similar atmospheric response across the basins, which consists of a destabilization of the bottom of the atmospheric column, as observed from the equivalent potential temperature anomalies near the surface. However, the presence of a relatively strong surface convergence over the Arabian Sea, due to the presence of a strong zonal gradient in SST, which accelerates the upward motion of the moist air, results in a relatively faster response in terms of the local precipitation anomalies over the Arabian Sea than over the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. With respect to the observations, the ocean-atmosphere coupling is well simulated in the model, though with an overestimation of the intraseasonal SST anomalies, leading to an exaggerated SST-precipitation relationship. A detailed examination points to a systematic bias in the thickness of the mixed layer of the ocean model, which needs to be rectified. A too shallow (deep) mixed layer enhances (suppress) the amplitude of the intraseasonal SST anomalies, thereby amplifying (lessening) the ISV and the active-break phases of the monsoon in the model.","[Roxy, Mathew; Preethi, B.; Terray, Pascal; Krishnan, R.] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Tanimoto, Youichi] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Tanimoto, Youichi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Tanimoto, Youichi] JAMSTEC, Res Inst Global Change, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Terray, Pascal] IPSL, Lab Oceanog Dynam & Climatol, Paris, France",Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Centre for Climate Change Research - India; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite,"Roxy, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",roxy@tropmet.res.in,"Koll, Roxy Mathew/B-5863-2008; IFCWS, LMI/C-5187-2013; Tanimoto, Youichi/F-8819-2012","Koll, Roxy Mathew/0000-0001-9311-5162; terray, Pascal/0000-0002-3982-6630","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [22340132, 22340135, 22106007]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22340135] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Constructive suggestions and comments from two anonymous reviewers have helped in improving the manuscript.

In this study, we use global observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite for years 2015-2019 and a geostatistical inverse model to evaluate 5 years of interannual variability (IAV) in CO2 fluxes and its relationships with environmental drivers. OCO-2 launched in late 2014, and we specifically evaluate IAV during the time period when OCO-2 observations are available. We then compare inferences from OCO-2 with state-of-the-art process-based models (terrestrial biosphere model, TBMs). Results from OCO-2 suggest that the tropical grasslands biome (including grasslands, savanna, and agricultural lands within the tropics) makes contributions to global IAV during the 5 year study period that are comparable to tropical forests, a result that differs from a majority of TBMs. Furthermore, existing studies disagree on the environmental variables that drive IAV during this time period, and the analysis using OCO-2 suggests that both temperature and precipitation make comparable contributions. TBMs, by contrast, tend to estimate larger IAV during this time and usually estimate larger relative contributions from the extra-tropics. With that said, TBMs show little consensus on both the magnitude and the contributions of different regions to IAV. We further find that TBMs show a wide range of responses on the relationships of CO2 fluxes with annual anomalies in temperature and precipitation, and these relationships across most of the TBMs have a larger magnitude than inferred from OCO-2. Overall, the findings of this study highlight large uncertainties in process-based estimates of IAV during recent years and provide an avenue for evaluating these processes against inferences from OCO-2.","[Chen, Zichong; Miller, Scot M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Huntzinger, Deborah N.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Liu, Junjie] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Piao, Shilong; Wang, Xuhui] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Anthoni, Peter; Arneth, Almut] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Bastrikov, Vladislav] CEA CNRS UVSQ, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, CE Orme Merisiers, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Goll, Daniel S.] Univ Augsburg, Lehrstuhl Phys Geog Schwerpunkt Klimaforsch, Augsburg, Germany; [Haverd, Vanessa] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Jain, Atul K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL USA; [Joetzjer, Emilie] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Unite Mixte Rech 3589 Meteo France CNRS, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31100 Toulouse, France; [Kato, Etsushi] Inst Appl Energy IAE, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1050003, Japan; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Phys Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Lienert, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Lombardozzi, Danica L.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam, Terr Sci Sect, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [McGuire, Patrick C.] Univ Reading, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Dept Meteorol, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Melton, Joe R.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Climate Res Div, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Nabel, Julia E.

It analyses the meaning of a modernity shared between the continents under the influence of Le Corbusier, Modern art and architecture. The technologies and the ideologies of the Modern movement emerged during the 1950s as a cultural stimulus articulated by geographical and climatic specificities which favored an unexpected modern creation. Adaptation to the climate is especially visible in the treatment of open spaces. The design of galleries of circulation, the introduction of means of permanent ventilation and of control of solar light are recurrent in all of these projects. They evoke principles developed by Le Corbusier for tropical climates, in North Africa and in South America. Le Corbusier participated in the spread of Modern art in the intercultural triangle connecting Paris, Brazil, and Africa. This initiatory journey towards Africa in order to find the trace of the tribal culture known through sculpted masks was undertaken by the Portuguese architects who had studied in the atelier of the Rue de Sevres. They discovered this end of the world in the mysterious and wild Africa and found there the roots of modernity: the primitive that is to say the primary, the original, and the authentic that they were seeking.","[Tostoes, Ana] Univ Lisbonne, Inst Super Tech, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,,,,,,,,,57,0,0,1,4,EDITIONS C N R S,PARIS,"20/22 RUE ST.

Large regions in western North America have become more favorable to the MPB, which has extended its range into higher elevations and more northerly latitudes, previously considered climatically unsuitable. Various investigators, and recent forest health surveys in Alberta have suggested that the beetle's range could shift further east on both lodgepole (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and jack pine (Pious banksiana Lamb.) into the boreal forest. A risk assessment of the threat of MPB to Canada's boreal forest identified effective monitoring and detection in areas vulnerable to infestation as the most critical information need. Changing climate may also be independently impacting pine forests, for instance through moisture stress. Species' vulnerability to climate change is reflected in modeled increases or decreases in the probability of its presence across its range. We hypothesize that areas within the current ranges of lodgepole and jack pine that have historically been sub-optimal for beetle expansion may become increasingly vulnerable as a result of climate change. In our analysis, we first test the ability of physiologically-based models to predict the recorded distributions of lodgepole and jack pine for 12,456 ground plots across British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, using monthly climatic data derived for a calibration period between 1950 and 1975. Both the presence and absence of the two tree species recorded on survey plots were predicted, on average, with an accuracy of 85% for the calibration period. We then identified locations that appear to have become less suitable for these pine species in each subsequent year between 1976 and 2006 and found that the suitable range area for lodgepole and jack pine for > 50% of years in the period decreased by 45% and 40%, respectively. These results were compared with outputs from a climate-suitability model that identified areas of potential range expansion by MPB for two periods: 2001-2030 and 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable lodgepole pine forests that coincided with the area of potential beetle expansion was 40,000 km(2) in 2001-2030 and 45,000 km(2) in 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable jack pine was much less, ranging from 4000 to 8000 km(2) for the two periods. This analysis is unique in that it acknowledges the complexity of the beetle-host interaction by incorporating the potential impact of climate change on each of these elements into predictions of future host susceptibility to infestation. Such information is vital for assessing the ongoing risk of MPB range expansion and for designing future monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Radiocarbon dates of oxalates that cover or encapsulate rock paints have become the primary strategy for establishing chronologies of these artifacts. It is also apparent that oxalate films form episodically and are governed by particular climate conditions and thus could serve as a paleoclimate proxy. However, the mechanism(s) by which these coatings form remains unresolved. Here, we report on the trace organic composition of oxalate-coating samples from the Lower Pecos Canyonlands in southwestern Texas. The samples contained a suite of dicarboxylic acids that are similar to the organic composition established for atmospheric aerosols. The predominant organic species in aerosols is oxalic acid, which reacts with calcium to form calcium oxalate. This suggests that aerosols could be a mechanism for the production of naturally occurring calcium oxalate on rock surfaces.","[Ginsberg, Sarah A.; Rayburn, Logan P.; Bray, Asya J.; Nunuz-Parker, Francisco S.; Dowling, Amelia; Russ, Jon] Rhodes Coll, Dept Chem, Memphis, TN 38112 USA",,"Russ, J (corresponding author), Rhodes Coll, Dept Chem, Memphis, TN 38112 USA.",Russj@rhodes.edu,,,,,,,56,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-6353,1520-6548,,GEOARCHAEOLOGY,Geoarchaeology,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/gea.21947,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gea.21947,,22-Nov,12,"Archaeology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI),Archaeology; Geology,5X7AE,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000878750100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we present a high-precision time series of climate changes in the Austrian Alps that coincide with the later portion of Termination III (TIII), the entire penultimate interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7), Termination Ma (TIIIa), and the penultimate glacial inception (MIS 7-6 transition). Using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry techniques, we have constructed a uranium-series chronology with relative age uncertainties averaging 1.7%0 (2 sigma) for our study period (247 to 191 thousand years before present, ka). Results reveal the onset of warming in the Austrian Alps associated with TIII at 242.5 +/- 0.2 ka and the duration of MIS 7e warming between 241.8 and 236.7 (+/- 0.6) ka. An abrupt shift towards higher delta O-18 values at 216.8 ka marks the onset of regional warming associated with TIIIa. Two periods of high delta O-18 values (greater than -10 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)) between 215.9-213.3 and 204.3-197.5 (+/- 0.4) ka coincide with interglacial substages MIS 7c and 7a, respectively. Multiple fluorescent inclusions suggest a partial retreat of the local Alpine glacier during peak obliquity forcings at 214.3 +/- 0.4 ka. Two newly collected stalagmites from Spannagel Cave (SPA146 and 183) provide high-resolution replications of the latter portion of the MIS 7a-to-6e transition. The resulting multistalagmite record reveals important chronological constraints on climate shifts in the Austrian Alps associated with MIS 7 while offering new insight into the timing of millennial-scale changes in the North Atlantic realm leading up to TIII and TIIIa.","[Wendt, Kathleen A.; Spotl, Christoph] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Geol, Innrain 52, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Li, Xianglei; Edwards, R.

Structural health monitoring (SHM) is critical in determining the life expectancy of civil structures. The advancement of various sensors and data acquisition systems (DAQ) has enabled more accurate prediction of the life span of civil structures subjected to static and dynamic loading conditions. Hence, SHM is a critical area of research to understand the condition and lifetime of structures such as dams.

Although wheat is growing on 215 million hectares annually, its production is still inadequate to meet the future demand of feeding the 10 billion human population. Global food security is the biggest challenge as climate change is threatening crop production. There is a need to fast-track the wheat breeding by devising modern biotechnological tools. Climate-smart wheat having greater stress resilience, better adaptability and improved agronomic traits are vital to guarantee food security. Substantial understanding and knowledge of vital biochemical pathways and regulatory networks is required for achieving stress resilience in wheat. Metabolomics has emerged as a fascinating technology to speed up the crop improvement programs by deciphering unique metabolic pathways for abiotic/biotic stress tolerance. State-of- the-art metabolomics tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and advanced mass spectrometry (MS) has opened new horizons for detailed analysis of wheat metabolome. The identification of unique metabolic pathways offers various types of stress tolerance and helps to screen the elite wheat cultivars. In this review, we summarize the applications of metabolomics to probe the stress-responsive metabolites and stress-inducive regulatory pathways that govern abiotic/biotic stress tolerance in wheat and highlight the significance of metabolic profiling to characterize wheat agronomics traits. Furthermore, we also describe the potential of metabolomics-assisted speed breeding for wheat improvement and propose future directions.","[Razzaq, Ali; Khan, Muhammad Sarwar; Saleem, Fozia] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Ctr Agr Biochem & Biotechnol CABB, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [Guul, Wajiha] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Natl Inst Food Sci & Technol NIFSAT, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [Saleem, Fozia] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Alberta,"Saleem, F (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Ctr Agr Biochem & Biotechnol CABB, POB 38040, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",fozia@ualberta.ca,"Razzaq, Ali/AAA-2480-2020","Razzaq, Ali/0000-0002-9122-3714",,,,,110,1,1,11,31,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",0929-8665,1875-5305,,PROTEIN PEPTIDE LETT,Protein Pept.

We show that this mass shift is captured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) unconstrained global solutions at a 400 km spatial resolution after removing correlated errors. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) is selected to isolate the TGR contribution from regional water storage changes. For the first time, this study compares the GRACE (minus WGHM) estimated TGR volume changes with in situ measurements from April 2002 to May 2010 at a monthly time scale. During the 8 year study period, GRACE-WGHM estimated TGR volume changes show an increasing trend consistent with the TGR in situ measurements and lead to similar estimates of impounded water volume. GRACE-WGHM estimated total volume increase agrees to within 14% (3.2 km(3)) of the in situ measurements. This indicates that GRACE can retrieve the true amplitudes of large surface water storage changes in a concentrated area that is much smaller than the spatial resolution of its global harmonic solutions. The GRACE-WGHM estimated TGR monthly volume changes explain 76% (r(2) = 0.76) of in situ measurement monthly variability and have an uncertainty of 4.62 km(3). Our results also indicate reservoir leakage and groundwater recharge due to TGR filling and contamination from neighboring lakes are nonnegligible in the GRACE total water storage changes. Moreover, GRACE observations could provide a relatively accurate estimate of global water volume withheld by newly constructed large reservoirs and their impacts on global sea level rise since 2002.","[Wang, Xianwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xianwei; de Linage, Caroline; Famiglietti, James; Zender, Charles S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Famiglietti, James] Univ Calif Irvine, UC Ctr Hydrol Modeling, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",Sun Yat Sen University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Wang, XW (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, 135 W Xingang Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangxw8@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Wang, Xianwei/E-2146-2011; Famiglietti, James S/G-7383-2017; Zender, Charles S/D-4485-2012","Famiglietti, James S/0000-0002-6053-5379; Zender, Charles S/0000-0003-0129-8024","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2011CB707103]; Sun Yat-sen University; NASA [NNX07AR23G, NNG04GE99G]; NSF [ARC-0714088]",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); Sun Yat-sen University; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank all the researchers who deploy, operate, and maintain TGR water level, volume, inflow, and outflow data from China Three Gorges Corporation and the Information Center of Water Resources (ICWR), China; level 2 solutions of GRACE data in the Center for Space Research (CSR) at the University of Texas at Austin, United States; and CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) and NCEP reanalysis data provided by Physical Sciences Division, Earth System Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, United States; we thank Andreas Guentner, GeoForschung Zentrum (GFZ), Potsdam, Germany, for providing WaterGAP simulations.

However their adoption mainly depends on the willingness to pay for the extra cost of the traction battery. The goal of this paper is to predict the cost of a battery pack in 2030 when considering two aspects: firstly a decade of research will ensure an improvement in material sciences altering a battery's chemical composition. Secondly by considering the price erosion due to the production cost optimization, by maturing of the market and by evolving towards to a mass-manufacturing situation. The cost of a lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) battery (Cathode: NMC 6: 2: 2; Anode: graphite) as well as silicon based lithium-ion battery (Cathode: NMC 6: 2: 2; Anode: silicon alloy), expected to be on the market in 10 years, will be predicted to tackle the first aspect.

To this end we study the fate of lower tropospheric wave events (LTWEs) and their interaction with the stratospheric mean flow. These LTWEs are contrasted with sudden stratospheric deceleration events (SSDs), which are similar to sudden stratospheric warmings but place more emphasis on the explosive dynamical nature of such events. Reanalysis and model output provide very similar statistics: Around one-third of the identified SSDs are preceded by wave events in the lower troposphere, while two-thirds of the SSDs are not preceded by a tropospheric wave event. In addition, only 20% of all anomalous tropospheric wave events are followed by an SSD in the stratosphere. This constitutes statistically robust evidence that the anomalous amplification of wave activity in the stratosphere that drives SSDs is not necessarily due to an anomalous amplification of the waves in the source region (i.e., the lower troposphere). The results suggest that the dynamics in the lowermost stratosphere and the vortex geometry are essential, and should be carefully analyzed in the search for precursors of SSDs.","[De La Camara, Alvaro] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Earth Phys & Astrophys, Madrid, Spain; [De La Camara, Alvaro] CSIC, Inst Geosci, Ctr Mixto, Madrid, Spain; [De La Camara, Alvaro] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Birner, Thomas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Meteorol Inst, Munich, Germany; [Albers, John R.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Albers, John R.] NOAA, Phys Sci Div, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UCM - Instituto de Geociencias (IGEO); Complutense University of Madrid; University of Munich; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"De La Camara, A (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Earth Phys & Astrophys, Madrid, Spain.;De La Camara, A (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Geosci, Ctr Mixto, Madrid, Spain.;De La Camara, A (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",acamarai@ucm.es,"Birner, Thomas/A-2108-2008; Birner, Thomas/FFE-8380-2022; de la Camara, Alvaro/P-7062-2016","Birner, Thomas/0000-0002-2966-3428; Birner, Thomas/0000-0002-2966-3428; de la Camara, Alvaro/0000-0002-8831-4789",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation grant PaleoStrat'' [CGL2015-69699]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation grant Steady'' [CGL2017-83198-R]; UCM research fellowship Personal posdoctoral de formacion en docencia e investigacion en los Departamentos de la UCM; U.S. National Science Foundation Climate Dynamics Program [1643167],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation grant PaleoStrat''; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Innovation grant Steady''; UCM research fellowship Personal posdoctoral de formacion en docencia e investigacion en los Departamentos de la UCM; U.S. National Science Foundation Climate Dynamics Program,"The authors are thankful to three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, and toMarta Abalos and Blanca Ayarzaguena for helpful discussions.

Therefore, this paper evaluates the capability of the state-of-the-art Atmospheric GCM of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP-AGCM) in simulating summer rainfall over Thailand by comparing the model's results with ground-truth observation during 1981-2012. Generally, the model shows a certain skill in reproducing the observed spatial distribution of the summer rainfall climatology and its interannual variability over Thailand, although the model underestimated both rainfall amount and its variability. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, it is found that the IAP climate model reproduced creditably the spatial patterns of the first three dominant modes of summer rainfall in Thailand, whereas it underestimated the explained variance of the observed EOF-1 and overestimated the explained variance of the observed EOF-2 significantly. It was further found that the correlation between the observed rainfall anomalies in Thailand and the Nino3.4 index can be reproduced by the IAP model. However, the observed negative correlation is largely underestimated by the IAP climate model, and this could be the reason for the underestimation of explained variance of the EOF-1 by the IAP model. The evaluation results would be of great importance for further model improvement and thus potential application in seasonal prediction in the region.","[Torsri, Kritanai; Lin, Zhaohui; Dike, Victor Nnamdi; Zhang, He; Wu, Chenglai; Yu, Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Torsri, Kritanai; Lin, Zhaohui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Torsri, Kritanai] Minist Higher Educ Sci Res & Innovat, Hydroinformat Inst, Bangkok 10900, Thailand; [Dike, Victor Nnamdi] Imo State Polytech Umuagwo, Energy Climate & Environm Sci Grp, Owerri 464119, Nigeria; [Yu, Yue] Minist Nat Resources, State Key Lab Satellite Ocean Environm Dynam, Inst Oceanog 2, Hangzhou 310012, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China","Lin, ZH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Lin, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",kritanai@hii.or.th; lzh@mail.iap.ac.cn; victor@mail.iap.ac.cn; zhanghe@mail.iap.ac.cn; wuchenglai@mail.iap.ac.cn; yuyue@mail.iap.ac.cn,"Dike, Victor Nnamdi/J-7734-2018","Dike, Victor Nnamdi/0000-0003-2268-5859; , Chenglai/0000-0002-8397-2424; LIN, Zhaohui/0000-0003-1376-3106; Torsri, Kritanai/0000-0003-2795-806X; Yu, Yue/0000-0003-1788-7261","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604304]; Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) [48873, 160399]; National Key Scientific and Technological Infrastructure project",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI); National Key Scientific and Technological Infrastructure project,"This study was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0604304), and the Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) under Fundamental Fund No. 48873 and No. 160399.

However, this comes at the cost of a (too) tight short-term remaining emission budget, limiting the model suitability to analyze low-emission scenarios accurately. With DICE2016R, the compliance with the 2 degrees C goal is no longer feasible without negative emissions via CDR.

Such proposed techniques would not be able to substitute for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a response to the risks of climate change, as they would only mask some of the effects of global warming. They might, however, eventually be applied as a complementary approach to reduce climate risks. Thus, the Earth system consequences of solar geoengineering are central to understanding its potentials and risks. Here we review the state-of-the-art knowledge about stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection and an idealized proxy for this, sunshade geoengineering,' in which the intensity of incoming sunlight is directly reduced in models. Studies are consistent in suggesting that sunshade geoengineering and stratospheric aerosol injection would generally offset the climate effects of elevated GHG concentrations. However, it is clear that a solar geoengineered climate would be novel in some respects, one example being a notably reduced hydrological cycle intensity. Moreover, we provide an overview of nonclimatic aspects of the response to stratospheric aerosol injection, for example, its effect on ozone, and the uncertainties around its consequences. We also consider the issues raised by the partial control over the climate that solar geoengineering would allow. Finally, this overview highlights some key research gaps in need of being resolved to provide sound basis for guidance of future decisions around solar geoengineering.

Classical civilisation, whose gravitational centre was perceived, during the 1880s, as the perfection of the body in a Mediterranean climate, was re-claimed in France as a French golden age, an inheritance from Greek ancestors. This ethno-classicism which called for national regeneration through return to the authentic French self and its Mediterranean home, was combined with a Catholic revival under conditions of military defeat. The essay sets the work of Cezanne and Renoir in the context of the two revivals, classical and Catholic, and shows the ways in which their classicism gave Impressionism order and solidity and re-moulded the modern body into a strong, healthy, and, at the same time, pious body.","Univ Reading, Sch Languages & European Studies, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Leoussi, AS (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Languages & European Studies, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",,,"LEOUSSI, ATHENA/0000-0001-6323-4814",,,,,109,9,9,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1073-0508,,,INT J CLASS TRADIT,Int.

Adaptive Dynamic Building Envelopes (ADBEs) exploit the benefits of technologies that manage the energy and mass transfer between building and outdoor environments actively and selectively. There is a wide range of technologies used in the design of ADBEs that differ from one another in terms of user controllability and the level of how active or passive their technologies are. This paper provides a systematic search in literature on the technologies devised in the ADBEs, specifying the most prevalent practices, and highlights the most cutting-edge research approximations. The analysis shows more than half of the studies use photovoltaics (PVs) in their design. Using mechanical ventilation and heat pumps were the next popular choices. Moreover, approximately half of the studies were carried out using simulation methods alone, whereas only 13% of studies couple simulations with experimental work. This highlights a clear gap in coupling digital modeling and simulation software with practical field testing and successful mass production.","[Mohtashami, Negar; Fuchs, Nico; Streblow, Rita; Osterhage, Tanja; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Energy Efficient Bldgs & Indoor Climate, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Fotopoulou, Maria; Drosatos, Panagiotis] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas CERTH, Maroussi 15125, Greece",RWTH Aachen University; Centre for Research & Technology Hellas,"Mohtashami, N (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Energy Efficient Bldgs & Indoor Climate, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",negar.mohtashami@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; nico.fuchs@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; fotopoulou@certh.gr; drosatos@certh.gr; rstreblow@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; tosterhage@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de; dmueller@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,"Streblow, Rita/0000-0001-7640-0930; Fotopoulou, Maria/0000-0001-7064-9145; Fuchs, Nico/0000-0002-8576-5656",European Union [768735],European Union(European Commission),This study is funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under project Plug-n-Harvest with grant agreement No. 768735.,,184,2,2,6,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,FEB,2022,3,,,,,,829,10.3390/en15030829,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15030829,,,28,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,YY8SB,,gold,,,12/21/22,WOS:000755054700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By comparing the CFS simulation with corresponding observation-based analyses or reanalyses, it is shown that the CFS captures the seasonal mean climate, including the zonal gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, even though the CFS produces warm mean biases and underestimates the variability over the southeastern ocean. The seasonal transition from warm to cold phase along the equator is delayed 1 month in the CFS compared with the observations. This delay might be related to the failure of the model to simulate the cross-equatorial meridional wind associated with the African monsoon. The CFS also realistically simulates both the spatial structure and spectral distributions of the three major leading patterns of the SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic Ocean: the south tropical Atlantic pattern (STA), the North tropical Atlantic pattern (NTA), and the southern subtropical Atlantic pattern (SSA). The CFS simulates the seasonal dependence of these patterns and partially reproduces their association with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The dynamical and thermodynamical processes associated with these patterns in the simulation and the observations are similar. The air-sea interaction processes associated with the STA pattern are well simulated in the CFS. The primary feature of the anomalous circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) associated with the NTA pattern resembles that in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) linked with the SSA pattern, implying a similarity of the mechanisms in the evolution of these patterns and their connection with the tropical and extratropical anomalies in their respective hemispheres. The anomalies associated with both the SSA and NTA patterns are dominated by atmospheric fluctuations of equivalent-barotropic structure in the extratropics including zonally symmetric and asymmetric components. The zonally symmetric variability is associated with the annular modes, the Arctic Oscillation in the NH and the Antarctic Oscillation in the SH. The zonally asymmetric part of the anomalies in the Atlantic is teleconnected with the anomalies over the tropical Pacific. The misplaced teleconnection center over the southern subtropical ocean may be one of the reasons for the deformation of the SSA pattern in the CFS.","[Hu, Zeng-Zhen; Huang, Bohua; Pegion, Kathy] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; [Huang, Bohua] George Mason Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Climate Dynam, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Hu, ZZ (corresponding author), Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Suite 302, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",hu@cola.iges.org,"Hu, Zeng-Zhen/B-4373-2011; Pegion, Kathy/E-1525-2013","Hu, Zeng-Zhen/0000-0002-8485-3400; Pegion, Kathy/0000-0001-5820-7678; Huang, Bohua/0000-0003-4869-3849",,,,,60,11,11,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-7575,,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

During the Late Boreal and Early Atlantic Chronozones birch woodland established itself in the more favourable places, especially fjord lowlands and inland valleys. The development of birch woodland suffered a setback due to a transient climatic oscillation some 7500 C-14 years ago, but recovered again relatively quickly and more than 6000 C-14 years ago birch woodland covered the lowland areas both in northern and southern Iceland. At that time it reached its highest altitude, at least in northern Iceland. During the Late Atlantic and Subboreal Chronozones the birch woodland showed a retrogressive succession towards a more open landscape with expanding mires and heaths. There is some conflict between the evidence from pollen percentages, which indicate that the woodland regenerated several times during the latter half of the Holocene, and pollen influx values which reflect no such regeneration of the woodland. New habitats were created for birch after a period of cool climate and instability during the Early Subatlantic Chronozone as fresh screes and sandur plains became vegetated, at least partly, by woodland. This development was halted at the beginning of the Norse settlement, which resulted in further opening of the woodland. The birch woodland closest to the farms in the lowland of Iceland was cut and utilized for timber and fuel. Grazing of domestic animals opened the landscape still further and the previous woodland never re-established itself. This happened within only half a century from the arrival of the first settlers. During the ensuing 1100 years of human influence the sub-alpine birch woodland has been so intensively utilized that only in fenced, protected areas and at the most inaccessible and remote places has birch survived. The shrub and dwarf-shrub heaths, widespread mires, fell fields, and hay fields so characteristic for the Icelandic landscape at present thus developed as a relatively recent phenomenon in the form in which they appear today. A number of areas are identified for future research: elucidating the origins of the Icelandic flora, deriving palaeoclimatic data from the vegetation record, correlating terrestrial with marine and ice core records and expanding our understanding of the human impact on vegetation.","[Hallsdottir, Margret] Iceland Inst Nat Hist, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Caseldine, Chris J.] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Hallsdottir, M (corresponding author), Iceland Inst Nat Hist, Reykjavik, Iceland.",,,,,,,,0,45,47,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1571-0866,,978-0-08-053439-8; 978-0-44-450652-8,DEV QUATER SCI,,,2005,,,,,319,334,,,,,,16,"Geography, Physical; Geology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology,BCW57,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000311687800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some weakening may already have occurred over the past century(2), and global climate models project further weakening in response to anthropogenic climate change(3). Such a weakening could have significant impacts on the surface climate(4). However, ocean model simulations based on historical conditions have often found an increase in overturning up to the mid-1990s, followed by a decrease(5). It is therefore not clear whether the observed weakening over the past decade is part of decadal variability or a persistent weakening(6). Here we examine a state-of-the-art global-ocean reanalysis product, GloSea(5), which covers the years 1989 to 2015 and closely matches observations of the AMOC at 26.5 degrees N, capturing the interannual variability and decadal trend with unprecedented accuracy. The reanalysis data place the ten years of observations-April 2004 to February 2014-into a longer-term context and suggest that the observed decrease in the overturning circulation is consistent with a recovery following a previous increase. We find that density anomalies that propagate southwards from the Labrador Sea are the most likely cause of these variations. We conclude that decadal variability probably played a key role in the decline of the AMOC observed over the past decade.","[Jackson, Laura C.; Peterson, K.

Spatiotemporal recurrences of the system hint to the presence of a low-dimensional manifold containing the highdimensional climate trajectory that could make the problem more tractable. Here we argue that reproducing the geometrical and topological properties of the low-dimensional attractor should be a key target for models used in climate projections. In doing so, we propose a general data-driven framework to characterize the climate attractor and showcase it in the tropical Pacific Ocean using a reanalysis as observational proxy and two state-of-the-art models. The analysis spans four variables simultaneously over the periods 1979???2019 and 2060???2100. At each time t, the system can be uniquely described by a state space vector parametrized by N variables and their spatial variability. The dynamics is confined on a manifold with dimension lower than the full state space that we characterize through manifold learning algorithms, both linear and nonlinear. Nonlinear algorithms describe the attractor through fewer components than linear ones by considering its curved geometry, allowing for visualizing the highdimensional dynamics through low-dimensional projections. The local geometry and local stability of the high-dimensional, multivariable climate attractor are quantified through the local dimension and persistence metrics. Model biases that hamper climate predictability are identified and found to be similar in the multivariate attractor of the two models during the historical period while diverging under the warming scenario considered. Finally, the relationships between different subspaces (univariate fields), and therefore among climate variables, are evaluated. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive, physically based, test for assessing climate feedbacks and opens new avenues for improving their model representation.","[Falasca, Fabrizio] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Falasca, Fabrizio; Bracco, Annalisa] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",New York University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Falasca, F (corresponding author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.;Falasca, F (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",fabri.falasca@nyu.edu,,,"Department of Energy, Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program [0000253789]; National Science Foundation [NSF PHY-1748958]","Department of Energy, Regional and Global Model Analysis (RGMA) Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank Predrag Cvitanovic and the ChaosBook [94] team who influenced many of the ideas in this work.

Community size-spectrum models exploit this feature to represent marine ecosystems with two measures: the slope and the intercept (height) of the community spectrum. Size-spectrum models have gain popularity over time to model the properties of fish communities, whether to investigate the impact of fishing, or embedded into end-to-end models to investigate the impact of climate. We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This interest has, however, resulted in a multiplicity of views that have tended to obfuscate rather than clarify the affect-LMX nexus. To deal with this lack of clarity, we conducted a systematic integration of affect-LMX literature published in leading journals since 2000, including the role of personal affectivity, discrete affect, emotional intelligence, emotional labor, and affective climate. We structured our review using a multilevel framework of affect that encompasses five levels of analysis: (1) within-person, (2) between persons, (3) interpersonal, (4) team, and (5) organizational levels; as well as consideration of cross-level effects. We address in particular three fundamental issues that we argue may have hampered the development of the affect-LMX nexus in the literature: theoretical diversity, problems of data analysis, and measurement issues. We conclude by discussing opportunities for future research across the different levels and develop a set of research questions that we hope will help to promote research into the role of affect in LMX.","[Tse, Herman H.

More than six decades have elapsed since the beginning of systematic ecological research in the Venezuelan paramos, making them one of the best-studied tropical alpine regions in the world. Aims: We review the conceptual development and state of the art of ecological research in the Venezuelan paramos, with emphasis on environmental and plant ecology research, presenting a general framework for the studies included in this special issue. Methods: We provide a historical sketch of the periods that have marked ecological studies in the Venezuelan paramos. Then, we synthesise research on environmental drivers, plant population and community ecology, ecosystem functioning, the response of the paramo to climate change and human disturbance; we finally consider agroecology and conservation. Results and conclusions: This review demonstrates the significant contributions made to alpine ecology in key areas such as biodiversity/ecosystem function changes during succession, nutrient cycling, species interactions and socio-ecological research. We indicate the need to develop a more integrated view of the links between evolutionary processes, functional diversity, community dynamics and ecosystem services both in natural and human-impacted areas.","[Daniel Llambi, Luis; Rada, Fermin] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Merida, Venezuela",University of Los Andes Venezuela,"Llambi, LD (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol, Merida, Venezuela.",llambi@ula.ve,,"Rada, Fermin/0000-0003-4486-2414; Llambi, Luis Daniel/0000-0002-2031-810X",,,,,165,7,7,2,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-0874,1755-1668,,PLANT ECOL DIVERS,Plant Ecol.

Here, we assess the subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictive skill of the ASL in two state-of-the-art forecasting systems based on the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC). It is found that the ASL predictability during austral spring is higher than in the other seasons with lead times ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. The spring ASL predictability has an ACC of about 0.6 with lead times of 1-2 weeks and about 0.44 with lead times of 3-4 weeks. The enhanced ASL predictability during austral spring is mainly due to the strengthening of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, coincident with a weakened stratospheric polar night jet and increased wave-mean flow interactions in the stratosphere. This study demonstrates that the stratosphere-troposphere coupling provides an important source of predictability for the Antarctic surface weather and climate on S2S timescale.","[Wang, Shaoyin; Cheng, Xiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaoyin; Cheng, Xiao] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiping] SUNY Albany, Dept Atmospher & Environm Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Kerzenmacher, Tobias; Braesicke, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Wang, Shaoyin; Cheng, Xiao] Univ Corp Polar Res, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Wang, SY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wang, SY (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.;Wang, SY (corresponding author), Univ Corp Polar Res, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",wangshy96@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Kerzenmacher, Tobias/AGN-7243-2022; Braesicke, Peter/D-8330-2016","Kerzenmacher, Tobias/0000-0001-8413-0539; Braesicke, Peter/0000-0003-1423-0619; Wang, Shaoyin/0000-0003-4742-4719",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFA0605901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41676185]; Chinese Scholarship Council,National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"We thank Jiankai Zhang, Xinyu Li, and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments on the manuscript.

Most freshwater lakes in the Netherlands are very shallow (< 2 m), and owe their origins to large-scale dredging and removal of peat during the early 17th century. They vary in area from a few hectares to a few thousand hectares, and are generally found in the northern and western part of the country. Most of them lie in the catchment areas of the major rivers: the Rhine, the Meuse and the Schelde. Because of their natural and aesthetic value, these lakes fulfil a recreational function. The lakes are important to the hydrology, water balance and agriculture in the surrounding polder country. The external input to the lakes of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and of polluted waters from the rivers and canals have been the major cause of eutrophication, which began during the 1950s. In addition, more recently climate changes, habitat fragmentation and biotic exploitation of many of these waters have probably led to loss of resilience and thus to accelerated eutrophication. Lake eutrophication is manifested essentially in the poor under-water light climate with high turbidity (Secchi-disc, 20-40 cm) caused usually by cyanobacterial blooms (e.g. Oscillatoria sp.), and loss of littoral vegetation. Despite recent perceptible reductions in external P inputs, non-point sources, especially of N from agriculture, still remain high and constitute a major challenge to the lake restorers. Lake recovery is also invariably afflicted by in-lake nutrient sources. These include P loading from the P-rich sediments, mineralization in the water and release by the foraging and metabolic activities of the abundant benthivorous and planktivorous fish, mainly bream (Abramis brama). A variety of restoration techniques have been employed in the Dutch lakes: hydrological management, reduction of P in the external loads, in-lake reduction or immobilisation of P, and complementary ecological management. This last involves biomanipulation, or the top-down control of the food web. Hydrological management has resulted in an improvement in the lake water quality only in a few cases. The failure of lake restoration measures (e. g. in the Loosdrecht lakes, described as a case study) has led water managers to use biomanipulation in other lakes under restoration. Lake biomanipulation principally involves reducing the existing planktivore population, bream in most cases, and introducing piscivores such as northern pike (Esox lucius). Lake Zwemlust is discussed as a case study, with brief mention of some other small lakes which have been biomanipulated. The restoration studies reveal that decrease of P to low levels is no guarantee that cyanobacterial populations will also follow suit. This is because cyanobacteria can withstand great variation in their P content and thus in their C: P ratios. Thus, for a unit weight of P, the Cyanobacteria can yield relatively more biomass and cause greater turbidity than, for example, green algae, which have relatively lower C: P ratios. This is possibly an explanation for the success of these filamentous Cyanobacteria in many Dutch lakes, and the failure of restoration endeavours. In addition, a falling trend in chlorophyll-a content in these shallow lakes does not set off an immediate increase in lake transparency because of resuspension of seston and inorganic suspended matter from the lake bottom by both wind-induced waves and fish foraging activity. The zooplankton-grazing peak in spring, caused usually by large-bodied grazers, Daphnia spp., is invariably the first step in bringing about a clear-water phase. Subsequently, summer light conditions trigger optimal growth conditions for macrophytes, which then maintain the high water clarity by competing successfully with phytoplankton for nutrients, especially N. The 'return' of macrophytes, especially stoneworts(Chara spp.) in some lakes, has contributed to the sustaining of improved light conditions and success of the restoration measures. In addition to competing with phytoplankton for nutrients, the macrophytes exert their positive influence in manifold ways. They act as a major nutrient sink, provide refuges for zooplankton and young pike and reduce wind- and fish-induced bioturbation of sediment. Most restoration accomplishments in recent years have been attributed to the success of aquatic macrovegetation. In general, the achievements of restoration work in the Dutch lakes, especially those using biomanipulation measures, are questionable: there are probably more examples of failures than of successes. The failures are generally linked not only to insufficient or no decrease at all in the autochthonous or in-lake nutrient loadings, but also to rapid increase of the planktivorous fish in the years following their reduction. A 75% reduction in the existing planktivore population has often been used as an arbitrary yardstick for effective reduction, but may not be sufficient. However, fish stock reductions to <50 kg FW ha(-1) and maintenance at that level might have a greater chance of success, though maintaining the existing fish population at preconceived levels is difficult since for reasons not yet fully understood, piscivores, pike in particular, fail to develop sizeable populations. Studies so far have helped us recognise that for sustainability of the positive effects on water quality, 'natural development' should be central to future lake restoration programmes. Future restoration plans typically visualise lakes as integral parts of their landscape, and envisage their 'nature development'. Such thinking aims at reinforcing the lakes' shoreline vegetation to prevent erosion and improve the subtlety of the land-water transition (e.g. Volkerak Zoommeer lake system). Where in-lake P stocks have retarded the pace of lake recovery (e.g. Loosdrecht Lakes), excavation of 20-30 m deep pits in shallower lake areas to allow wind- induced shifting of the nutrient-rich upper sediment layers and burial in the pits in order to hinder P releases from the sediments is now under way. For some lakes the creation of artificial islands to reduce the wind fetch factor and erosion has been planned; in other cases, more natural development of the quasi-aquatic ecosystems by water-level management in order to encourage the shoreline macrovegetation to develop has been planned. Such plans also have the provision of extending the upper and lower limits for permissible annual water-level fluctuations and exploring the effects of transient draw-downs. Ideally, near-natural water levels, unlike the current levels, are under consideration as possibly being the best option, also bearing climate change in mind. However, the consequences of flooding and recessions on the ecosystems and other water uses by man still need to be thoroughly investigated. In short, the experiences acquired from the failures and some successes of the last two decades should pave the way to development of more enduring strategies for sustainable restoration of our lake ecosystems.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW),"Gulati, RD (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, Rijksstr Weg 6, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands.",gulati@cl.nioo.knaw.nl,"Gulati, Ramesh D/F-4943-2013; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Gulati, Ramesh D./A-3155-2011","van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; ",,,,,149,240,276,18,590,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JUN,2002,3-Jan,,,,73,106,,10.1023/A:1021092427559,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021092427559,,,34,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,614BR,,,,,12/21/22,WOS:000179168500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Besides the broadband sensors that have been traditionally used for monitoring Earth's Energy Budget (EEB), data from a variety of narrowband sensors aboard both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites have also been extensively employed to estimate the EEB components. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the satellite missions, state-of-the art estimation algorithms and the satellite products, and also synthesizes current understanding of the EEB and spatio-temporal variations. The TOA components include total solar irradiance, reflected shortwave radiation/planetary albedo, outgoing longwave radiation, and energy imbalance. The surface components include incident solar radiation, shortwave albedo, shortwave net radiation, longwave downward and upwelling radiation, land and sea surface temperature, surface emissivity, all-wave net radiation, and sensible and latent heat fluxes.

The implications for densely populated island nations, whose livelihoods depend on ecosystem services, are significant. A unique suite of in situ measurements coupled with state-of-the-art GCM simulations enables us to quantify the mitigation potential of the projected circulation change for three coral reef ecosystems under two future scenarios. Estimated historical trends indicate that over 100% of the large-scale warming to date has been offset locally by changes in circulation, while future simulations predict a warming mitigation effect of only 5-10% depending on the island.

The study focuses on the fast responses (including land surface feedbacks, but without sea surface temperature feedbacks) to sudden changes in emissions from Asia and Europe. The initial responses, over days 1-40, to Asian and European emissions show large differences. The response to Asian emissions involves a direct impact on the sulphate burden over Asia, with immediate consequences for the shortwave energy budget through aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions. These changes lead to cooling of East Asia and a weakening of the EASM. In contrast, European emissions have no significant impact on the sulphate burden over Asia, but they induce mid-tropospheric cooling and drying over the European sector. Subsequently, however, this cold and dry anomaly is advected into Asia, where it induces atmospheric and surface feedbacks over Asia and the Western North Pacific (WNP), which also weaken the EASM. In spite of very different perturbations to the local aerosol burden in response to Asian and European sulphur dioxide emissions, the large scale pattern of changes in land-sea thermal contrast, atmospheric circulation and local precipitation over East Asia from days 40 onward exhibits similar structures, indicating a preferred response, and suggesting that emissions from both regions likely contributed to the observed weakening of the EASM. Cooling and drying of the troposphere over Asia, together with warming and moistening over the WNP, reduces the land-sea thermal contrast between the Asian continent and surrounding oceans. This leads to high sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies over Asia and low SLP anomalies over the WNP, associated with a weakened EASM. In response to emissions from both regions warming and moistening over the WNP plays an important role and determines the time scale of the response.","[Dong, Buwen; Sutton, Rowan T.; Wilcox, Laura J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Highwood, Eleanor J.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science; University of Reading; University of Reading,"Dong, BW (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England.",b.dong@reading.ac.uk,"Wilcox, Laura J/F-3394-2013","Wilcox, Laura J/0000-0001-5691-1493; Sutton, Rowan/0000-0001-8345-8583; Dong, Buwen/0000-0003-0809-7911","PAGODA project of the Changing Water Cycle programme of UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I006672/1]; European Union [607085]; U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I022469/1, NE/I006672/1, ncas10009] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I006672/1, NE/I022469/1] Funding Source: UKRI",PAGODA project of the Changing Water Cycle programme of UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Union(European Commission); U.K. National Centre for Atmospheric Science-Climate (NCAS-Climate) at the University of Reading; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work is supported by PAGODA project of the Changing Water Cycle programme of UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under Grant NE/I006672/1 and the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement no 607085.

An unforced internal component that varies on multidecadal time scales is identified by a new statistical method that maximizes integral time scale. This component, called the internal multidecadal pattern (IMP), is stochastic and hence does not contribute to trends on long time scales; however, it can contribute significantly to short-term trends. Observational estimates indicate that the trend in the spatially averaged well observed sea surface temperature (SST) due to the forced component has an approximately constant value of 0.1 K decade(-1), while the IMP can contribute about +/- 0.08 K decade(-1) for a 30-yr trend. The warming and cooling of the IMP matches that of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and is of sufficient amplitude to explain the acceleration in warming during 1977-2008 as compared to 1946-77, despite the forced component increasing at the same rate during these two periods. The amplitude and time scale of the IMP are such that its contribution to the trend dominates that of the forced component on time scales shorter than 16 yr, implying that the lack of warming trend during the past 10 yr is not statistically significant. Furthermore, since the IMP varies naturally on multidecadal time scales, it is potentially predictable on decadal time scales, providing a scientific rationale for decadal predictions. While the IMP can contribute significantly to trends for periods of 30 yr or shorter, it cannot account for the 0.8 degrees C warming that has been observed in the twentieth-century spatially averaged SST.","[DelSole, Timothy; Shukla, Jagadish] Ctr Ocean Land Atmosphere Studies, Calverton, MD USA; [DelSole, Timothy; Shukla, Jagadish] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Tippett, Michael K.] Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA",George Mason University,"DelSole, T (corresponding author), COLA, 4041 Powder Mill Rd,Ste 302, Calverton, MD 20705 USA.",delsole@cola.iges.org,"DelSole, Timothy/ABE-2478-2020","DelSole, Timothy/0000-0003-2041-3024; Tippett, Michael/0000-0002-7790-5364","National Science Foundation [ATM0332910, ATM0830062, ATM0830068]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNG04GG46G, NNX09AN50G]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA04OAR4310034, NA09OAR4310058, NA05OAR4311004]; U.S. Department of Energy",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful and extensive comments, which lead to significant improvements in the methodology and presentation of this work.

This study presents a systematic evaluation of dust emitting-winds in 30 years of the historical model simulation with the UK Met Office Earth-system model HadGEM2-ES for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Isolating the effect of winds on dust emission and using an automated detection for nocturnal low-level jets (NLLJs) allow an in-depth evaluation of the model performance for dust emission from a meteorological perspective. The findings highlight that NLLJs are a key driver for dust emission in HadGEM2-ES in terms of occurrence frequency and strength. The annually and spatially averaged occurrence frequency of NLLJs is similar in HadGEM2-ES and ERA-Interim from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Compared to ERA-Interim, a stronger pressure ridge over northern Africa in winter and the southward displaced heat low in summer result in differences in location and strength of NLLJs. Particularly the larger geostrophic winds associated with the stronger ridge have a strengthening effect on NLLJs over parts of West Africa in winter. Stronger NLLJs in summer may rather result from an artificially increased mixing coefficient under stable stratification that is weaker in HadGEM2-ES. NLLJs in the Bod,l, Depression are affected by stronger synoptic-scale pressure gradients in HadGEM2-ES. Wintertime geostrophic winds can even be so strong that the associated vertical wind shear prevents the formation of NLLJs. These results call for further model improvements in the synoptic-scale dynamics and the physical parametrization of the nocturnal stable boundary layer to better represent dust-emitting processes in the atmospheric model. The new approach could be used for identifying systematic behavior in other models with respect to meteorological processes for dust emission. This would help to improve dust emission simulations and contribute to decreasing the currently large uncertainty in climate change projections with respect to dust aerosol.","[Fiedler, Stephanie; Knippertz, Peter; Ross, Andrew N.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Fiedler, Stephanie; Knippertz, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Fiedler, Stephanie] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Woodward, Stephanie; Martin, Gill M.; Bellouin, Nicolas] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Bellouin, Nicolas] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Heinold, Bernd; Schepanski, Kerstin; Tegen, Ina] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Birch, Cathryn E.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, MetOff Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Max Planck Society; Met Office - UK; University of Reading; Leibniz Institut fur Tropospharenforschung (TROPOS); University of Leeds,"Fiedler, S (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Fiedler, S (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.;Fiedler, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Bundesstr 53, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",stephanie.fiedler@mpimet.mpg.de,"Tegen, Ina/W-4299-2018; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Ross, Andrew N/D-9312-2011; Schepanski, Kerstin/I-7967-2015","Tegen, Ina/0000-0003-3700-3232; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Ross, Andrew N/0000-0002-8631-3512; Schepanski, Kerstin/0000-0002-1027-6786; Fiedler, Stephanie/0000-0001-8898-9949; Bellouin, Nicolas/0000-0003-2109-9559",European Research Council [257543]; Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Program [GA01101],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Joint UK DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Program,"This work has been carried out as part of the Desert Storms project funded by the European Research Council under Grant Number 257543.

The article suggests the compatibility of the venerated status gained by donors who are Israeli Defense Force combatants with Zionist militarism. The banks screen candidates for sperm donation based on their military service and military health profile. The discursive climate which glorifies warriors' permeates sperm marketing, contributing to the cultural reproduction of a militaristic ideology. The article concludes by contending that sperm banks provide a platform for a subversive discourse that triggers Enloe's thesis of patriotic motherhood and the role of women in the process of militarization.","[Bokek-Cohen, Ya'arit] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Bokek-Cohen, Y (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol, Ramat Gan, Israel.",ybokek@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-9236,1465-3869,,J GENDER STUD,J.

In this sense, its forecast is an important task, and predictions are issued on a regular basis by a wide array of prediction schemes and climate centres around the world. This study explores a novel method for EN forecasting. In the state-of-the-art the advantageous statistical technique of unobserved components time series modeling, also known as structural time series modeling, has not been applied. Therefore, we have developed such a model where the statistical analysis, including parameter estimation and forecasting, is based on state space methods, and includes the celebrated Kalman filter. The distinguishing feature of this dynamic model is the decomposition of a time series into a range of stochastically time-varying components such as level (or trend), seasonal, cycles of different frequencies, irregular, and regression effects incorporated as explanatory covariates. These components are modeled separately and ultimately combined in a single forecasting scheme. Customary statistical models for EN prediction essentially use SST and wind stress in the equatorial Pacific. In addition to these, we introduce a new domain of regression variables accounting for the state of the subsurface ocean temperature in the western and central equatorial Pacific, motivated by our analysis, as well as by recent and classical research, showing that subsurface processes and heat accumulation there are fundamental for the genesis of EN. An important feature of the scheme is that different regression predictors are used at different lead months, thus capturing the dynamical evolution of the system and rendering more efficient forecasts. The new model has been tested with the prediction of all warm events that occurred in the period 1996-2015. Retrospective forecasts of these events were made for long lead times of at least two and a half years. Hence, the present study demonstrates that the theoretical limit of ENSO prediction should be sought much longer than the commonly accepted Spring Barrier. The high correspondence between the forecasts and observations indicates that the proposed model outperforms all current operational statistical models, and behaves comparably to the best dynamical models used for EN prediction. Thus, the novel way in which the modeling scheme has been structured could also be used for improving other statistical and dynamical modeling systems.","[Petrova, Desislava; Ballester, Joan; Rodo, Xavier] Catalan Inst Climate Sci IC3, Climate Dynam & Impacts Unit, Carrer Dr Trueta 203, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain; [Petrova, Desislava] Univ Barcelona, Dept Phys, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Koopman, Siem Jan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ballester, Joan] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rodo, Xavier] ICREA, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Institut Catala de Ciencies del Clima (IC3); University of Barcelona; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; California Institute of Technology; ICREA,"Petrova, D (corresponding author), Catalan Inst Climate Sci IC3, Climate Dynam & Impacts Unit, Carrer Dr Trueta 203, Barcelona 08005, Catalonia, Spain.;Petrova, D (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Phys, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",desislava.petrova@ic3.cat,"Rodó, Xavier/F-7663-2017; Koopman, Siem Jan/E-1838-2011; Koopman, S.J./M-7814-2019; Ballester, Joan/E-6627-2017","Rodó, Xavier/0000-0003-4843-6180; Koopman, Siem Jan/0000-0002-4440-9524; Koopman, S.J./0000-0002-4440-9524; Ballester, Joan/0000-0003-0009-437X","European Commission through a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (Project MEMENTO) [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IOF call]; European Commission; Catalan Government through a Marie Curie-Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship [00068]; Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain [PANDORA CGL 2007-63053]; ICREA Funding Source: Custom","European Commission through a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (Project MEMENTO); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Catalan Government through a Marie Curie-Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship; Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); ICREA(ICREA)","J.B. gratefully acknowledges funding from the European Commission through a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (Project MEMENTO from the FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IOF call), and from the European Commission and the Catalan Government through a Marie Curie-Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship (Project 00068 from the BP-DGR-2014-B call).

All of the 17 models used in this study are identified to give reasonable eastern-Pacific (EP) El Nino-related sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and anomalous Walker circulation compared with observations, whereas one-third of the models fail to reproduce the Walker circulation anomalies for central-Pacific (CP) El Nino. In these models, negative SSTA over the eastern-to-central Pacific are found to be too strong, while positive SSTA shift to the western Pacific during CP El Nino. There is thus sinking (rising) motion over the central (western) part of the Pacific basin, implying westward displaced anomalous Walker cells, relative to the observed. This results in simulated low-level cyclonic flow and positive rainfall anomalies over the far western north Pacific/South China Sea during and after the peak phase of CP El Nino, which are opposite to the observed anomalous climate state. The other two-thirds of models, with realistic CP El Nino-related anomalous Walker cell, can better reproduce the corresponding wind circulation and rainfall anomalies over East Asian (EA) region. The contrasting CP El Nino-related teleconnection among models mainly arises from the different simulated CP El Nino SSTA, which in turn determine the circulation anomalies through a Gill-type response. Further analyses reveal that, in the mean state of models with erroneous teleconnection, there exists a large cold SST bias over the eastern Pacific. The stronger Walker circulation, and possibly the stronger Bjerknes feedback, might be responsible for the overly negative SSTA associated with CP El Nino in the vicinity. Our results highlight the sensitivity of El Nino-EA climate linkage to the oceanic state in models, especially for CP El Nino events.","[Wang, Peng; Tam, Chi-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Kang] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS","Tam, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",Francis.Tam@cuhk.edu.hk,"Tam, Francis Chi Yung/AAI-2990-2021; XU, Kang/M-2574-2013; Tam, Francis C Y/T-7218-2018","Tam, Francis Chi Yung/0000-0002-5462-6880; XU, Kang/0000-0003-3149-6005; Tam, Francis C Y/0000-0002-5462-6880; WANG, Peng/0000-0002-5437-9330","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41776023, 41731173]; Chinese University [4053283]; Rising Star Foundation of the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology [NHXX2018WL0201]; State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography [LTOZZ1802]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese University; Rising Star Foundation of the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology; State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography,"This work is jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41776023 and 41731173), the Chinese University Direct Grant (4053283), the Rising Star Foundation of the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology (NHXX2018WL0201), and the Independent Research Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography (LTOZZ1802).

However, doing so can prove challenging when multiple models and large domains are considered. Here an approach to PDF quantification using k-means clustering is considered. A standard clustering algorithm (with k=5 clusters) is applied to 33years of daily January surface temperature from two state-of-the-art reanalysis products, the North American Regional Reanalysis and the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications. The resulting cluster assignments yield spatially coherent patterns that can be broadly related to distinct climate regimes over North America, e.g., low variability over the tropical oceans or temperature advection across stronger or weaker gradients. This technique has the potential to be a useful and intuitive tool for evaluation of model-simulated PDF structure and could provide insight into projections of future changes in temperature.","[Loikith, P.

The system, which comprises a set of numerical models, state-of-the-art methodologies and numerical databases, is prepared to provide a method for coastal practitioners, researchers and decision-makers to address coastal issues, such as erosion and flooding or to evaluate coastal defense structures. The system incorporates a method to transfer numerically generated, calibrated and validated wave series to the surf zone; to estimate the sediment littoral drift by means of up-to-date formulations; and to estimate the flooding level and impacts such as those produced by climate change. In this paper, these skills are detailed. The system, which is adaptable to any coastal region, was implemented for the Brazilian coast (SMC-Brasil). The implementation includes databases and methodological adaptations to local characteristics, a dissemination plan and the development of several study cases.","[Quetzalcoatl, O.; Gonzalez, M.; Canovas, V; Medina, R.; Espejo, A.; Almeida, L.

To halt this trend, several international agreements have been made, and various biodiversity metrics have been developed to evaluate whether the targets of these agreements are being met. The process of developing good indicators is not trivial. Indicators should be able to synthesize and communicate our current knowledge, but they also need to meet both scientific and practical criteria. Since it would not be practical to monitor all species, indicators are mainly built on the monitoring of some well-known taxa, such as birds. Here we systematically review the wide spectrum of bird biodiversity indicators (hereafter indicators) available to: i) evaluate recent methodological advances; ii) identify current knowledge gaps jeopardizing indicator interpretation and use in guiding decision-making; and iii) examine challenges in their applicability across different spatial and temporal contexts. We pay particular attention to indicator characteristics such as site and species selection, spatial, seasonal and habitat coverage, and statistical issues in developing indicators and tools to tackle them, to provide specific recommendations for the future construction of indicators. Several methodological advances have recently been made to enhance the process of indicator development, including multiple ways to select sites and species to increase their robustness. However, we found that there are strong spatial, seasonal and habitat biases among the selected indicators. Most of them are from Europe, using mainly census data from the breeding season and typically covering farmland and forest habitats. The major challenges that we detected in their applicability were related to the modelling of the statistical uncertainty associated to the indicator. We recommend the use of quantitative methods in site and species selection procedures whenever possible. Current indicators should be expanded to areas outside Europe and to less studied habitats and should not neglect monitoring work outside the breeding season. Time-series analyses studying temporal trends and using multi-species data should in general account for temporal autocorrelation as well as for phylogenetic correlation. Multi-species hierarchical models are a good alternative for analysing and constructing indicators, but they need to include annual random effects allowing for unexplained annual variation in the average status of the community, i.e. the indicator target. Despite methodological and context-specific differences in the indicators reviewed, most of them seem to highlight the urgent need of devising strategic climate and conservation policies to improve the status and trends of biodiversity.","[Fraixedas, Sara; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 4, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Fraixedas, Sara; Cabeza, Mar] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Global Change & Conservat Lab, POB 4, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Linden, Andreas] Novia Univ Appl Sci, FI-10600 Ekenas, Finland; [Piha, Markus; Lehikoinen, Aleksi] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Gregory, Richard] RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, Potton Rd, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; [Gregory, Richard] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, Darwin Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Lehikoinen, Aleksi] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki Lab Ornithol HelLO, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Novia University of Applied Sciences; University of Helsinki; Royal Society for Protection of Birds; University of London; University College London; University of Helsinki,"Fraixedas, S (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 4, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",sara.fraixedas@helsinki.fi,"Fraixedas, Sara/AAH-3568-2021; Linden, Andreas/D-9315-2017","Fraixedas, Sara/0000-0003-1407-0387; Lehikoinen, Aleksi/0000-0002-1989-277X; Linden, Andreas/0000-0002-5548-2671; Piha, Markus/0000-0002-8482-6162; Cabeza, Mar/0000-0002-7410-7631; Gregory, Richard/0000-0002-7419-5053",Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation; Helsinki Institute of Sustainability Science (HELSUS); Academy of Finland [275606],Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Helsinki Institute of Sustainability Science (HELSUS); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"Sara Fraixedas received financial support for conducting this research from the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation, the Finnish Cultural Foundation, and the Helsinki Institute of Sustainability Science (HELSUS), and Aleksi Lehikoinen from the Academy of Finland (grant 275606).
